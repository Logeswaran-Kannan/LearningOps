No luck with the support team in setting up Outlook, AVC, and Veridium. They said they’ll reach out to me in the next 30 minutes—seems like the resource activation isn’t fully completed yet. For now, you can reach me on Teams.

In the meantime, any updates on the ADM account? I’d like to try accessing Databricks.

This release primarily addresses the following report requirements and their supporting components:

Policy Terms Exceptions Reporting:

As insurance policies near their expiry date, they automatically go through a renewal process where policy risk data is resubmitted to generate renewal quotes.
These quotes are processed in batches, and the resulting prices are used to prepare customer renewal invitations.
The current CDL system lacks the capability to identify and report exceptions in this process, necessitating an alternative solution.
The new automated process will identify exceptions, analyze the data using business rules, and generate outputs for further analysis and remedial action.
Business To Agent Dashboard:

Renewal data from the CDL Policy system will be integrated into the existing Call Centre sales dashboard.
This will provide a unified view of AA sales and separate views for AA Tiara and CDL AA sales to meet the Business to Agent call handling requirements.
Existing Insurance Reports:

Reports like value measures, pricing remedies, panel changes, and data extracts for panel changes will remain unaffected by the renewal data integration, as they have separate requirements for upcoming releases.

Rephrased Test Summary:

1. System Test Coverage: System testing across various layers including analytical, reference, silver, gold, dataset, and dashboard has been completed for the specific tables outlined in the High-Level Design (HLD) and test plan.

2. Orchestration Process Testing: Testing has been conducted up to the gold layer in a pre-production environment. However, end-to-end orchestration, encompassing reporting and dataset functionalities, has not been performed due to a known limitation with scheduled refresh of reporting in the lower environment, mirroring production constraints.

3. Data Load and Incremental Validation: Initial validation has been completed in the test environment, followed by incremental validation in pre-production based on sample data analysis, as the renewal volume in pre-production is limited.

4. High-level Non-functional Validation: Performance and cost analysis validation has been conducted based on implemented optimization measures. However, the collected metrics were primarily for informational purposes, as the development team plans to enhance the code in future releases. No comparison has been made against historical benchmarks in testing.

5. Defects: There are open defects at severity levels S2 and S3 accepted by the business for release 1. However, there is a plan in place to rectify these defects in subsequent releases.

6. User Acceptance Testing (UAT): 
   - Aurora TS03: Conditional UAT sign-off has been obtained for release 1, with any reported changes during the warranty period addressed in future releases.
   - Policy Terms Exceptions Reporting: No UAT observations were provided during the UAT window, considered as sign-off obtained.
   - Business To Agent Dashboard: UAT sign-off with one open defect, with the understanding that the defect will be addressed in a future release.
   - Existing Insurance Reports: Not applicable.

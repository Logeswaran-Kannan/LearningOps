I've just had a conversation with Mahesh and clarified that there's no separate estimate needed because this is going as part of the TS03 release, not as a separate release. Mahesh has already informed Mitul about this. From a testing perspective, this needs to be included in the regression testing for B2A and GIPP reports during preproduction testing.

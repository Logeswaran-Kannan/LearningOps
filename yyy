Initial testing of the dimension reference tables is complete, and we are currently addressing defects and conducting revalidation.

Validation for the broker policy silver and fact is scheduled to commence on 7/02, but the build handover is expected on 09/02.

The data missing issue, attributed to CDL not being sent, is impacting the validation of business scenarios. Further analysis and a clean run are needed to prepare the test bed.

We have agreed to accept the risk of skipping table-level regression validation at Clev 4 until Mart, and as a result, we will only be conducting high-level regression testing on Reports. Any defects on the below list will be deferred and assigned to me. Bogdan, please only consider defects assigned to you. Also, please inform us when Clev 4 is ready for testing as we are aware that some changes are underway. For now, we will focus on revalidating defects in the silver layer during testing.

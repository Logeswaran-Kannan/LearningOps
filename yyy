Big thanks for confirming that the issue is sorted for your respective branches. Now, talking about the timeout thing, I was checking that link you shared â€“ seems like it's just covering the hour for running the test framework. It's not considering the time for loading the data, right?

Has anyone tried running this workbook in those pipelines to see if it goes through smoothly? I'm thinking, especially for the test framework that's clocking over 60 minutes, we might want to tweak things a bit. You know, like breaking it into two workflows or trimming down the data chunk. Hardeep's likely gonna raise eyebrows if we're telling him we need more than an hour just for running some test scripts, so optimizing the script performance could be a point we'd better get ahead of.

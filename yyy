This problem has two parts. First, the issue with the data type has been fixed in the Low-Level Design (LLD) to show correctly. The adjustments have been made, and now the development team will incorporate these changes into the code.

Secondly, there's an issue with missing cancellation dates suspected to be a data problem, as they're absent in the analytical layer itself. The design team will verify this, and the testing team will track the percentage of such occurrences to gauge the impact.

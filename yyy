Please see the current status of open defects for the T03 release below. Kindly review the comments and update the defects accordingly. Help us by updating the estimated time of arrival (ETA) for defect fixes and tracking the closure of defects on time. I will schedule defect triage sessions on alternate days initially to address open defects needing resolution. If necessary, we will extend these sessions to every day. Your support in resolving these issues promptly is greatly appreciated.

Could you please take a look at the dates set for testing each task and let me know if there are any changes needed? I'm aware that some of the test activities may have already passed their deadline, but we'll keep track of the actual time it took to finish them to understand any delays. If you think any tasks need more time than we originally estimated, please let me know so we can adjust the schedule or work around any obstacles. Once confirmed, I'll share the updates with Mitul, and we'll adjust the timeline during our weekly calls as needed.

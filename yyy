After examining the tests initially, it seems that there's a problem with the business event ID missing in the mv_account table. This issue causes the process type code and policy line items to be incorrectly linked to the policy event status code. We need more investigation from the development team to confirm this and resolve the missing business event ID problem, which could be due to a data loading issue.

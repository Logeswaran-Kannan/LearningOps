Dear Team,

I would like to reschedule our meeting to discuss the defect fix deployment status. Instead of meeting at our previously scheduled time, I propose we move the meeting to later today for a one-time occurrence. As we have already discussed most of the items in our daily stand-up, I feel that an end-of-day status update will be more useful.

Please let me know if this works for everyone, and if there are any conflicts with the proposed time. We can adjust accordingly if necessary.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

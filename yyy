Dear [Reference Agency],

I am writing to provide further clarification regarding my address history for the past three years, as requested in my application. I hope this email finds you well.

To confirm, for the first two years of the three-year period, I was in contact with the ABC rent agency, and my tenancy with them ended in October 2021. As proof of this, I have attached a tenancy end confirmation email for your reference.

For my current address, I have been staying with a friend, and we share only the utility bill. As proof of my current address, I have attached the latest utility bill to this email.

Please let me know if any additional information or documentation is needed to verify my address history. I will be happy to provide any further details that may be required.

Thank you for your assistance in this matter. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

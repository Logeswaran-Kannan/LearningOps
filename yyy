This release primarily addresses the following report requirements and their supporting components:

Policy Terms Exceptions Reporting:

As insurance policies near their expiry date, they automatically go through a renewal process where policy risk data is resubmitted to generate renewal quotes.
These quotes are processed in batches, and the resulting prices are used to prepare customer renewal invitations.
The current CDL system lacks the capability to identify and report exceptions in this process, necessitating an alternative solution.
The new automated process will identify exceptions, analyze the data using business rules, and generate outputs for further analysis and remedial action.
Business To Agent Dashboard:

Renewal data from the CDL Policy system will be integrated into the existing Call Centre sales dashboard.
This will provide a unified view of AA sales and separate views for AA Tiara and CDL AA sales to meet the Business to Agent call handling requirements.
Existing Insurance Reports:

Reports like value measures, pricing remedies, panel changes, and data extracts for panel changes will remain unaffected by the renewal data integration, as they have separate requirements for upcoming releases.

Rephrased Test Summary:

1. System Test Coverage: System testing across various layers including analytical, reference, silver, gold, dataset, and dashboard has been completed for the specific tables outlined in the High-Level Design (HLD) and test plan.

2. Orchestration Process Testing: Testing has been conducted up to the gold layer in a pre-production environment. However, end-to-end orchestration, encompassing reporting and dataset functionalities, has not been performed due to a known limitation with scheduled refresh of reporting in the lower environment, mirroring production constraints.

3. Data Load and Incremental Validation: Initial validation has been completed in the test environment, followed by incremental validation in pre-production based on sample data analysis, as the renewal volume in pre-production is limited.

4. High-level Non-functional Validation: Performance and cost analysis validation has been conducted based on implemented optimization measures. However, the collected metrics were primarily for informational purposes, as the development team plans to enhance the code in future releases. No comparison has been made against historical benchmarks in testing.

5. Defects: There are open defects at severity levels S2 and S3 accepted by the business for release 1. However, there is a plan in place to rectify these defects in subsequent releases.

6. User Acceptance Testing (UAT): 
   - Aurora TS03: Conditional UAT sign-off has been obtained for release 1, with any reported changes during the warranty period addressed in future releases.
   - Policy Terms Exceptions Reporting: No UAT observations were provided during the UAT window, considered as sign-off obtained.
   - Business To Agent Dashboard: UAT sign-off with one open defect, with the understanding that the defect will be addressed in a future release.
   - Existing Insurance Reports: Not applicable.

Based on the provided test summary, here are some potential risks associated with releasing the code into production:

1. **Incomplete Orchestration Testing**: Since end-to-end orchestration, including reporting and dataset functionalities, has not been fully tested due to limitations in the lower environments, there is a risk of encountering unexpected issues or failures in production related to these functionalities.

2. **Limited Data Load and Validation**: The validation of data loading and incremental validation was based on sample data analysis due to limited renewal volume in pre-production. This could result in overlooking potential issues that may arise when dealing with larger volumes of real-world data in the production environment.

3. **Non-functional Validation**: While high-level non-functional validation for performance and cost analysis was conducted, the metrics collected were solely for informational purposes. Without a comparison against historical benchmarks or thorough performance testing, there's a risk of performance degradation or cost inefficiencies in the production environment.

4. **Open Defects**: The presence of open defects at severity levels S2 and S3, accepted by the business for release 1, poses a risk as these defects may impact the functionality, usability, or stability of the system in production.

5. **Incomplete User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Sign-offs**: While UAT sign-offs have been obtained for some functionalities, there are instances where UAT sign-off was conditional or with open defects. This indicates potential issues that may affect user satisfaction or system usability in production if not addressed adequately.

6. **Limited Scope of Testing**: The scope of testing seems to be focused on specific functionalities and layers outlined in the test summary. However, there might be other areas or edge cases that haven't been thoroughly tested, increasing the risk of undiscovered issues in production.

Overall, the identified risks highlight the importance of thorough testing, validation, and defect resolution processes before releasing the code into production to mitigate the potential impact on system performance, functionality, and user experience.

___________________________________________________________

Based on the provided test summary, here are some potential risks associated with releasing the code into production:

1. **Incomplete Orchestration Testing**: Since end-to-end orchestration, including reporting and dataset functionalities, has not been fully tested due to limitations in the lower environment, there's a risk of undiscovered issues or discrepancies when the system is deployed in the production environment. This could lead to disruptions in data flow or reporting inaccuracies.

2. **Limited Data Volume for Validation**: The limited volume of data available for validation in the pre-production environment may not accurately represent real-world scenarios. This could result in undetected issues related to data integrity, performance, or scalability when the system is deployed in production with higher data volumes.

3. **Deferred Defect Resolution**: Although there is a plan to address open defects in subsequent releases, releasing the code with known defects (severity levels S2 and S3) into production poses a risk of impacting system functionality, user experience, or data integrity until these defects are resolved.

4. **Incomplete Performance Validation**: While high-level non-functional validation for performance and cost analysis has been conducted, the absence of comparison against benchmark history limits the ability to identify potential performance regressions or deviations from expected behavior in the production environment.

5. **Conditional UAT Sign-offs**: The conditional UAT sign-offs indicate that there may be unresolved issues or concerns raised during user acceptance testing. Releasing the code into production with conditional sign-offs increases the risk of encountering user-reported issues or dissatisfaction post-release.

6. **Dependency on Future Code Improvements**: Relying on future code improvements to address identified issues or optimization measures introduces the risk of delays or uncertainties in resolving these issues, potentially affecting system stability, performance, or user satisfaction in the production environment.

7. **Unforeseen Interactions**: The complex interactions between different system layers and components, as well as the potential impact of changes made in subsequent releases, introduce the risk of unforeseen issues or conflicts arising when the code is deployed into the production environment. 

To mitigate these risks, thorough regression testing, performance testing with realistic data volumes, proactive defect resolution, and closer collaboration between development, testing, and operations teams are recommended before releasing the code into production. Additionally, implementing robust monitoring and rollback procedures can help mitigate the impact of any unforeseen issues post-release.

_________________________________________________________

Based on the test summary provided, the following risks can be predicted for releasing the code into production:

Incomplete End-to-End Orchestration Testing:

Risk: Since end-to-end orchestration, including reporting and dataset functionalities, has not been tested due to a known limitation, there is a risk that these components may not function correctly in production.
Mitigation: Monitor the orchestration process closely after release and prepare for rapid issue resolution.
Known Defects (S2 and S3 Severity):

Risk: Open defects at severity levels S2 and S3 could impact user experience and system functionality, leading to potential disruptions or degraded performance.
Mitigation: Communicate these known issues to stakeholders, and ensure a plan is in place to address them promptly in subsequent releases.
Limited Data Load and Incremental Validation:

Risk: Validation based on limited sample data may not accurately reflect real-world scenarios, potentially leading to data load or processing issues in production.
Mitigation: Perform additional validation with a larger dataset post-release and be prepared for incremental fixes.
Non-functional Performance Metrics:

Risk: The performance and cost analysis metrics collected were for informational purposes only, without benchmarking against historical data. This could result in unexpected performance issues or higher costs in production.
Mitigation: Continuously monitor performance and cost metrics in production and optimize as necessary.
User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Observations:

Risk: Conditional UAT sign-offs and one open defect could mean that some issues might arise during actual use that were not fully addressed during testing.
Mitigation: Ensure a robust support process during the warranty period to handle any user-reported issues promptly.
Unaddressed Existing Insurance Reports:

Risk: Since existing insurance reports are marked as not applicable, there may be undiscovered issues or untested scenarios related to these reports.
Mitigation: Conduct targeted testing of these reports in production and address any issues as they arise.
By anticipating these risks and implementing appropriate mitigation strategies, the impact of releasing the code into production can be minimized, ensuring a smoother transition and better overall system stability.

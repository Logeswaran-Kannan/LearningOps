Any source data fix done by CDL is always a forward fix, meaning that certain functionalities, like add-ons, may have been partially addressed. Because of this, we were unable to test the fix in the test environment since the historical data became invalid due to the defect. This issue will also be present in production, indicating that any historical fix on CDL will always require a full refresh. We believe the issue with the add-ons was fixed on the source side on May 16th, and we plan to monitor this after it goes live in production.

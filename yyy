In this scenario, the interdependency between the workflows is causing the RTPLOG_ID to be populated erroneously in the silver layer. This issue is due to the nature of how the workflows are structured, creating a situation where the necessary data from the analytical layer isn't available in the expected manner.

Resolving this problem requires addressing the workflow dependency failure, ensuring that the analytical layer completes successfully before the silver layer processing begins. This synchronization is crucial to guarantee the accurate population of RTPLOG_ID and the proper functioning of data loading from the analytical layer to the silver layer.

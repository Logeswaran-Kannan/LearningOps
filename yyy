The support team hasn’t had any luck setting up Outlook, AVC, and Veridium yet. They mentioned they’ll reach out to me in the next 30 minutes. It looks like my resource activation isn’t fully completed yet, but for now, I can be reached on Teams.

In the meantime, is there any update on the ADM account? I’d like to check if I can at least access Databricks.

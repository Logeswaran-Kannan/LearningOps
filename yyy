Good Morning!

I was able to catch up with Nithin and got most of the issues resolved—just Outlook still pending.

Veridium ID – Completed ✅
Citrix Light Version (AVD) – Able to log in successfully ✅
Outlook:
Outside AVD – Seems to be an application issue; Nithin advised contacting the LV Service Desk.
Inside AVD – It's been processing for nearly 30 minutes now. If it doesn’t load soon, I may need to reach out to Nithin again.

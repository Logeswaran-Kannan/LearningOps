Hi [Colleague's Name],

Thank you so much for your kind words—it truly means a lot. It’s been an absolute pleasure working with you, and I’ve always appreciated your dedication and the energy you bring to the team.

You’ve got great potential to take on a team lead role someday, and I’m confident you’ll excel in that position when the time comes. My only advice? Don’t limit yourself to just testing or a narrow role. Keep exploring the exciting world of trending technologies—especially in areas like LLMs and AI models. The industry is evolving so fast, and I can see you contributing to those advancements in a big way.

Stay curious, keep pushing boundaries, and don’t hesitate to take on challenges that will help you grow. I’m certain you’ll do great things in your career, and I’ll be cheering you on from the sidelines.

Take care, and do keep in touch!

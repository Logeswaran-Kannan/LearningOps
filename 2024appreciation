I see you've scheduled a call for Mike's clarifications. Do you need any additional details or knowledge transfer (KT) from me before I revoke my production access for Kingfisher, Apollo, CDS, and DAVE 1 & 2? Apart from the Renewal Dataset, which will be removed after the Renewal Dataset UAT, is there anything else I should address? Regarding Mike's clarifications, could you clarify your expectations from me so I can prepare the relevant details?

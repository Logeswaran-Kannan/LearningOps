Subject: Celebrating Our Year of Success & Gratitude to the Team

Dear Team,

As we approach the end of this remarkable year, I want to take a moment to reflect on our achievements and express my heartfelt gratitude to each of you for your dedication, hard work, and perseverance.

We have been part of the Auro Program, a major transformation initiative undertaken by AA after many years. From the very beginning, the Data Quality Assurance Team played a pivotal role in this journey, ensuring the highest data quality standards and delivering excellence despite numerous challenges. Together, we not only overcame these hurdles but also gained and sustained client confidence—a truly significant achievement.

Key Accomplishments of the Year

Successful Release of TS02We started this year strong with the successful release of TS02, which earned us the Client Transformation Project of the Year Award in the Data & MI space—a testament to our collective effort and expertise.

Complex Renewal Piece Released into ProductionWe delivered a critical renewal component into production while working closely with the client to address data-related clarifications, ensuring a seamless process and building trust.

Delivery of Enterprise End-to-End BI ReportOur team successfully delivered a complex E2E BI report that empowers the business to make strategic decisions in trading and sales. This report analyzes financial data for 200,000 policies renewed, allowing the business to align decisions effectively.

Supporting 14 Business-Critical ReportsThe Auro Program stands out as the only program delivering and supporting 14 business-critical reports. These reports provide valuable insights into agents, sales, calls, renewals, new business, and external broker sales—ensuring data-driven decisions from the data warehouse.

Most Releases Delivered This YearOur team led the program with the highest number of releases in 2023, including both main and improvement releases. This has consistently strengthened client confidence by demonstrating our commitment to ongoing improvements and system enhancement.

Client Testimony

The client testimony we received this year is a clear reflection of the hard work, extended support, and exceptional quality we delivered. It underscores our collective efforts and unwavering commitment to success.

Gratitude to the Team

A big thank you to every member of the team whose hard work and contributions made these accomplishments possible. We take immense pride in our achievements and in leading the way for the Data Team across TS01 and TS02, particularly in SIT framework development, platform stability, and addressing data volume challenges. Our ability to align our test strategy with project strategy continues to set us apart.

Special recognition goes to everyone who played a part in achieving these milestones—your efforts are deeply appreciated.

As we approach the final phases of the program, I wish you all the best in completing the remaining pieces. Let’s continue to hold this pride, knowing that the skills, experiences, and learnings from this incredible journey will help you grow and advance in your careers.

Thank you once again for making this year a success. I look forward to seeing us achieve even greater heights together in the coming year.

Wishing you all a fantastic year ahead!

I don’t recall leaving anything pending on the intercepted report for RTK. As per our agreed game plan, my part of getting it UAT-ready was completed and handed over to you guys before New Year. I’ve already given you all the necessary details in the 3 UAT discussions we had, including the KPI validation sheet, derivations, reconciliation with pricing data, sample scenarios, entity mapping, source data issues, defect triaging, and RTP consolidation tickets. You and Koyena were part of those sessions, and I’ve shared my recommendations. If your open issues are resolved, just hand it over to UAT—that’s what we concluded in our daily connects. I don’t see any dependency on me at this point. Most challenges have been tackled, so this should be easy for you guys to release. You already have the template. If you need my review, feel free to reach out, but otherwise, it’s your show now.

Let’s clear the air here—everything you need is already in your handover notes. Just recording it here again to make it crystal clear. As you know, I’m moving in a couple of weeks, so my responsibility is to ensure all KT is complete and shadow anything you need to help you run things independently. For the next couple of weeks, here’s the deal:

Intercepted Report: You have all the details from me. I’m not your primary anymore, but I’ll support where I can, based on my other priorities.
Renewal Dataset: As per the game plan with Mitul’s handover to Stephen, the next priority is Renewal Dataset for UAT readiness to unblock Suriya. I’ve taken this on additionally to lighten your load, even though it wasn’t part of my original scope.
Interactions: This isn’t even on my radar, but I’ve still been helping you guys out here. My dependency seems to be increasing, which isn’t sustainable, especially since I’ll be gone soon.
Suj and Amber, I strongly suggest you connect with the team daily and guide them towards the goal—not just from a stats perspective but from a technical one as well. That way, the 4.5 PE effort gets balanced. This is the game plan I’m sticking to, as already discussed with Mitul and Stephen.

Next week, my focus will shift further away from technical support to process-oriented tasks, org induction, and my release readiness. Unfortunately, I can’t amend this game plan for any reason during my notice period. So, let’s keep moving forward with clarity and focus.

"I see you've scheduled a call for Mike's clarifications. Do you need any other details or knowledge transfer from me before I revoke my production access for Kingfisher, Apollo, CDS, and DAVE 1 & 2? The Renewal Dataset will remain until the UAT is completed. Regarding Mike's clarifications, what's the expectation from my side so I can prepare the relevant details? Also, let me know if there's anything specific you need from Mitul before he leaves, and I'll try to get that for you."

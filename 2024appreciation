Thank you so much for your kind message—it really means a lot to me! I just want to say, take care of your health first and don’t push yourself too hard. From personal experience, no amount of money or awards can replace the time you have with your family.

I’m serious about this—I hope you’ll take the message to heart. Wishing you all the best, both at work and in life! Stay in touch.

Take care,

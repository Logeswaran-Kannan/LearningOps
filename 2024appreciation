As part of the Gap Analysis conducted for the interaction report requirements (Requirement vs. Design vs. Build), we have identified several observations. Most of these were previously addressed and defeated as defects, but a couple of new defects have been raised based on the outcome of discussions with Mike.

Next Steps and Key Updates:

Design and Build Changes:
Based on the discussions, we will proceed with some design adjustments followed by the necessary build updates to align with the requirements.

Timeline Impact:

Changes will involve ETL and dataset updates, which Mahesh and Nars are already working on.
The testing team, along with Guy, will need to make the necessary updates to test scripts and datasets to ensure alignment.
A revised timeline needs to be estimated, considering inputs from the build, dataset, and testing perspectives.
These estimates can be gathered during tomorrow's defect triage from the respective teams.
Action Item for Koyena:
Please ensure that defect IDs are mapped to each of the items discussed with Mike. This will help maintain clarity and ensure everyone stays aligned.

Let me know if there’s anything specific you’d like to prioritize or discuss further during tomorrow’s triage session.

Still waiting for Mike to respond to Nishant's email, so I’ve added Mike T to this chat. Usually, when we notify Mike about observations in a chat, he checks and replies directly here. Since this is a new meeting thread, I’ve included him to make it quicker and easier to follow up with him."

Good morning and Happy New Year! I hope you're doing well. Nishant had sent an email regarding the incepted and interaction reporting requirements, with the subject line: 'Retention Toolkit - Business Requirement Clarification.' Could you please take a look and confirm? Let me know if you need anything further from my side.

Confirmation of Offboarding Activities

Hi [Recipient's Name],

I hope youâ€™re doing well. I wanted to confirm that all my offboarding activities have been completed as part of my exit process. Below are the details for your reference:

Laptop has been handed over to the AA IT team.
ID has been returned to the reception team.
Timesheets have been closed for this week in both Cognizant and AA systems.
All required access has been revoked, and knowledge transfer (KT) sessions have been completed.
Thank you so much for all the support during my time here. It has been a wonderful experience working with the team. Wishing you and the organisation continued success in the future.

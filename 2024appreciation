Subject: Renewal Dataset and Estimated UAT Readiness Timeline

Hi Stephen,

Following discussions with Suriya, Vinod, and myself regarding the renewal dataset, we’ve identified that this effort goes beyond reconciliation and will require a certain level of code changes accompanied by functional testing. Here’s the proposed plan and timeline:

Deliverable Split:

We recommend splitting the deliverables into policy-level and quote-level changes.
Policy-level changes are estimated to require 30–40% code modification.
Quote-level changes are estimated to require 50% code modification.
Timeline for Policy-Level Changes:

Code changes for the policy level are targeted for completion by mid-next week, followed by validation and handover for business UAT the week after.
Timeline for Quote-Level Changes:

While UAT is ongoing for the policy-level changes, the focus will shift to completing quote-level changes.
The release for both policy and quote-level changes is planned for 30th January, contingent on UAT completion.
Current Risks and Recommendations:

Offer Dataset Development: There’s a potential risk related to offer dataset development. A possible solution is assigning this task to Nars after he resolves the RTK interaction defects, given his familiarity with offer data. The development team can finalize this plan internally.
Renewal Dataset Extension: We noticed an additional task for "Renewal Dataset Extension" but currently lack background information. If we can obtain details about the required changes, we’ll aim to incorporate them into the code changes starting today.
Suriya, please feel free to add any points I might have missed.

Looking forward to your inputs and confirmation on the above.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

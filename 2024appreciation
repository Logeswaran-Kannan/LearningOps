Subject: Laptop Handover on My Last Working Day

Hi [Recipient's Name],

I hope you’re doing well. As today is my last working day, I wanted to confirm the process for handing over my company laptop and any other equipment.

Could you please let me know how I should go about dropping them off at the Basingstoke office? I’m happy to come by in person at a time that’s convenient for you.

Let me know if there’s anything else I need to do or any additional steps required.

Thank you for your guidance, and I appreciate your help with this!

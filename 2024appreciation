Release is tentatively scheduled for 30th January, following the completion of UAT for both policy and quote.
Current Risk:

The offer dataset development is a potential risk. While Suriya is focusing on the renewal dataset, we propose Nars could take up the offer dataset development post-completion of RTK interaction defects. Nars’ familiarity with offer data would be an advantage, but this will need to be internally planned by the development team.
Additional Task – Renewal Dataset Extension:

Currently, we lack background information on this task. If details about the changes required for the renewal extension can be provided, we can evaluate the feasibility of including them in the planned code updates starting today.
Suriya, please share your thoughts if I’ve missed anything or if there are additional considerations.

Hi Everyone,

As you may already know, my last working day at AA is next week. As part of my personal self-assessment process, I like to collect feedback about my time working with you. This feedback is purely for my own reflection and to help me gain insights into my tenure.

I would greatly appreciate it if you could share your thoughtsâ€”both positive and negative. Negative feedback is especially welcome, as it helps me grow. Please feel free to share your points based on our interactions and your perspective.

Thank you so much for taking the time to provide your feedback!

I believe this does not apply to online renewals, as we have observed some samples where interactions exist for online renewals but no negotiation takes place.

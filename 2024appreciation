"I see you've scheduled a call for Mike's clarifications. Do you need any other details or knowledge transfer from me before I revoke my production access for Kingfisher, Apollo, CDS, and DAVE 1 & 2? The Renewal Dataset will remain until the UAT is completed. Regarding Mike's clarifications, what's the expectation from my side so I can prepare the relevant details? Also, let me know if there's anything specific you need from Mitul before he leaves, and I'll try to get that for you."


As you move on to new opportunities, I just want to say it’s been an absolute pleasure working with you. Your guidance and leadership have made a lasting impact, and we’ll truly miss your presence. Wishing you all the best in your future endeavors—here’s to new beginnings and continued success!"

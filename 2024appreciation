Subject: Update on UAT Handover and Revised Timelines

Hi [Project Manager's Name],

Following discussions with Suriya, we anticipate a delay in the Policy UAT handover originally planned for next week. The revised handover date is now Thursday instead of Monday, due to the complexity of the required fix.

Reason for the Delay:
The fix involves a new logic change and integration with the existing framework on which the scripts are built, causing a delay in finalizing the handover for testing.
As per the revised plan:
The fix deployment will be completed by the end of today.
Testing will be performed on Friday and Monday.
Any issues identified during testing will be resolved on Tuesday and Wednesday.
However, if the fix window extends beyond this timeline, it will further delay the UAT handover.
Impact on Quote and Dependencies:
The delay in the Policy fix will also extend the Quote fix timeline.
There is an additional challenge with the dependency table shared between RTK and the Renewal dataset:
Both RTK and Renewal must either be released together as a single release.
Alternatively, the Renewal dataset release will need to be scheduled after the RTK release.
Updated Timelines:
The completion of UAT for both Quote and Policy, previously targeted for 29th January, is now extended to 4th February due to the Policy delay.
For the Inception Report, the production readiness is planned for 7th February, and we believe both RTK (Inception) and the Renewal dataset can be released together as a single release.
Please let me know if further adjustments are needed or if you’d like to discuss this in more detail.

Why is Access Required for Both S3 Console and Event Hub Access for Testing?
1️⃣ Amazon S3 Console Access
Why Required?

Enables batch data testing by allowing testers to inspect, validate, and manage files stored in S3.
Needed for manual verification of test data ingestion, format, and schema validation.
Required to re-upload or adjust test datasets if needed.
Supports troubleshooting by checking logs, file integrity, and access permissions.
Testing Scope with S3 Console:

Batch data ingestion validation.
Ensuring correct file format, schema, and completeness.
Manually uploading test datasets for different scenarios.
Checking access controls and permissions.
2️⃣ Event Hub Access
Why Required?

Real-time data validation is crucial for SIT automation.
Ensures streaming data pipelines are functioning correctly.
Helps in debugging failures in event-driven processing.
Required for tracking message delivery to Delta Lake for SIT validation.
Testing Scope with Event Hub:

Monitoring streaming data ingestion and real-time processing.
Ensuring event-driven messages reach downstream systems correctly.
Debugging issues like message loss, delays, or incorrect transformations.
Verifying event schema correctness and format.

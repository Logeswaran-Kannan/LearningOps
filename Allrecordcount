Subject: Schedule KT Session â€“ Silver Layer Table Identification

Hi Team,

I'd like to schedule a knowledge transfer (KT) session to discuss the identification of Silver Layer tables for our automation pipeline.

During the session, it would be helpful to review:

Any existing test scripts related to the Silver Layer

Any available LLD (Low-Level Design) documents

Other relevant documentation or details that could support the inclusion of the Silver Layer into the automation flow

Please share your availability so we can set up a time that works for everyone.

Thanks!

Subject: Daily Sync Call â€“ Migration Testing Alignment

Hi Team,

I'm scheduling a daily 20-minute sync call to help us stay aligned on the migration testing activities. The goal is to:

Discuss any dependencies, blockers, or clarifications

Align ourselves on test setup and related activities

Please let me know if the proposed time needs to be adjusted to better suit your availability.

Thanks and looking forward to our collaboration!

Best regards,
[Your Name]

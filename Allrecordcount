. Automated Framework POC
Description:
Create a Proof of Concept (POC) for an automated SIT testing framework.
The POC should cover:

Understanding the current data flow across systems.
Integration with data sources (e.g., Policy Center, Billing Center, Claim Center).
Designing the framework model script.
Implementing validation processes.
Creating dashboards for reporting.
Integrating Jira for defect and task tracking.
Definition of Done (DoD):

POC is implemented and demonstrated to the project team.
Feedback is incorporated.
Sign-off is received from stakeholders.
✅ 2. Automation Test Plan
Description:
Develop the Automation Test Plan based on the completed POC.
Key activities:

Define the automation strategy and scope.
Identify tools, frameworks, and test data approaches.
Document the test plan in Confluence for collaboration and approvals.
Definition of Done (DoD):

Test Plan documented in Confluence.
Reviewed and signed off by stakeholders.
✅ 3. In-Scope Table Identification for Data Validation
Description:
Identify and document all tables that are in-scope for SIT automated validation. This includes:

Source
ODS
ODS_VIEW
SILVER
GOLD
Outbound feed
Cover all key systems: Policy Center, Billing Center, Claim Center, and related reference tables.

Definition of Done (DoD):

List of in-scope tables reviewed and signed off.
Shared in Confluence or designated tracking sheet.
✅ 4. Test Coverage Identification for Automated SIT Validation
Description:
Define the coverage matrix for SIT data validation automation. Activities include:

Sample script creation for each validation type.
Cover data anomalies (e.g., NULLs, duplicates, counts).
Define rules and logic per validation type.
Definition of Done (DoD):

Test coverage matrix approved.
Sample scripts executed successfully with expected results.
Scripts reviewed and reusable for broader validation.
✅ 5. Test Environment Setup
Description:
Document and configure the test environment, including:

Source database details for all systems.
Read replica details.
Table-level metadata (names, schemas).
S3 source paths.
Access credentials and connection configuration.
Definition of Done (DoD):

All environment details documented and validated.
Access to all required environments is confirmed.
✅ 6. Test Data Availability
Description:
Ensure test data is available in all environments:

On-premises DB
Read Replica
S3 source
Activities include identifying required data sets, loading or syncing them, and validating their readiness for automated testing.

Definition of Done (DoD):

Required test data is available in each test environment.
Data validation checks passed (record counts, sample spot checks).
Ready for test execution.

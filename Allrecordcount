Thanks, I can see the folder structures now! I believe we need to refer to policycenter_sys9, but I noticed two parquet filesâ€”one inside the subfolder and one outside. Which one should we be using?

Also, I see that the files were generated today. Does that mean a new parquet file is created daily, or is it a single file that gets replaced each day with all previous data included?

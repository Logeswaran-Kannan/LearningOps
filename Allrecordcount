Test Environment Requirements â€“ Guidewire On-Premises to Cloud Migration

Based on the information provided by Graham, the designated environments are as follows:

PolicyCenter (PC) and BillingCenter (BC): sys9

ClaimCenter (CC): UAT4

Below are the connection details shared for these environments.

As part of the migration validation, our expectation is to receive three versions of each table for parallel comparison:

Source Oracle (on-prem)

Oracle Read Replica (cloud)

S3-based extract (cloud)

This setup will enable three-way parallel comparison of data.

Clear and consistent naming conventions should be defined for each version of the tables to avoid confusion during testing and analysis.

Based on the information shared by Graham, the environments are as follows: SYS9 for PC and BC, and UAT4 for CC. Below are the connection details provided.

Our expectation is to receive three versions of each table â€” from Oracle, Read Replica, and S3 â€” to enable a three-way parallel comparison. Naming conventions for each version will need to be clearly defined.

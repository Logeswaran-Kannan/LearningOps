The general automation pack should ideally include the Gold layer. I can add it as a skippable task for now — if time permits, we’ll run it during test execution. Otherwise, it will be part of the daily flow eventually, since it just involves plugging in the script.

I’m optimistic that the current optimization efforts will give us the bandwidth to validate the Gold layer as well.

Regarding ER/Studio — if it's license-restricted, I’ll explore an alternate route by referencing the existing manual scripts. As suggested, I’ll connect with Munish or Graham for a quick KT session.

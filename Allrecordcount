Ensures Data Consistency â€“ Direct access to the PostgreSQL read replica allows testers to validate that ingested data matches source system records without affecting the live production database.

Supports Complex Queries â€“ Testing requires running complex validation queries on large datasets, which is more efficient on a read replica than on real-time streaming or batch-processed data.

Facilitates Historical Data Validation â€“ The read replica maintains historical data, enabling testers to verify transformations, aggregations, and business logic across different time periods.

Reduces Performance Impact â€“ By using the read replica instead of the primary database, testing activities do not interfere with production workloads, ensuring stability.

Enables Schema and Data Integrity Checks â€“ Direct access allows testers to confirm schema consistency, column-level data integrity, and key constraints for accurate downstream processing.

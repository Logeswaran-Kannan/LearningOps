I don’t have any concerns with this approach. Based on the discussion with Paul yesterday, he confirmed there’s an alternate way for us to access data from the read replica in Databricks via the staging layer.

For manual access to PostgreSQL, I believe this tool should work without issues.
Could we go ahead and raise a request to get this tool installed on our machines?

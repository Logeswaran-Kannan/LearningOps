Test Environment Requirements â€“ Guidewire On-Premises to Cloud Migration

Based on the information provided by Graham, the designated environments are as follows:

PolicyCenter (PC) and BillingCenter (BC): sys9

ClaimCenter (CC): UAT4

Below are the connection details shared for these environments.

As part of the migration validation, our expectation is to receive three versions of each table for parallel comparison:

Source Oracle (on-prem)

Oracle Read Replica (cloud)

S3-based extract (cloud)

This setup will enable three-way parallel comparison of data.

Clear and consistent naming conventions should be defined for each version of the tables to avoid confusion during testing and analysis.

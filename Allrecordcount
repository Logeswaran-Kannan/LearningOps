Subject: Request to Create a Test Team & Channel in Teams for Webhook Testing

Hey [Scrum Master's Name],

Hope you're doing well!

As part of our framework development, I need to test message pushes from Databricks to Teams via a webhook. To do that, I’d like to set up a test team and a dedicated channel where we can run multiple test cases before integrating it into the final setup.

Could you help me create a test team in Microsoft Teams along with a channel (maybe something like "Databricks Webhook Testing")? I’ll try sending messages via the webhook, but I believe I might need Admin access for that. If it doesn’t work, I’ll go ahead and raise a service request for the required permissions.

Let me know what you think or if there’s anything I should check first. Appreciate your help!

Thanks,
[Your Name]

I'm working on implementing the CI/CD for the SIT framework that deploys workflows in Databricks, and I need repo access in Azure DevOps to get started. At the moment, my role as a stakeholder doesnâ€™t allow me to view repos, so Iâ€™m looking for Data Engineer role access to be able to copy the branch to a local repo and make changes on top of it.

Also, Iâ€™d need access to the main branch and pipeline details to understand the existing setup. Is there any document or Confluence page that outlines the doâ€™s and donâ€™ts of the current process? Would be great to have a reference before making any changes.

Let me know when you get a chance. Appreciate your help! ðŸ˜Š

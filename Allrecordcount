Just wanted to check—does the Oracle access request ticket we raised cover all three of us? Graham has my details, but I’m not sure if he submitted the request on my behalf. Is there any email thread related to this? If so, could you loop me in so I can stay informed when access is granted?

Also, I’m looking for a common read-only user ID that can be used for integration with our automation framework. I believe Paul is the DB admin—would it be possible to request this from him?

Let me know your thoughts. Thanks!

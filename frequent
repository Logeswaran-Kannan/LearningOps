Problem Statement: The data testing team needs to generate multiple test design documents from CSV files, involving various tables. This process is time-consuming and error-prone when done manually, hampering efficiency and accuracy.

Solution: An automated GUI application is developed using Python's tkinter library that allows the data testing team to select a template file, a table list file, and an output file. The application rapidly generates the test design documents for multiple tables simultaneously based on the template and table list files. It also provides the capability to seamlessly upload the generated documents to Azure DevOps, streamlining the documentation and collaboration process.

Benefits:

Speed: The automated tool creates test design documents in just 1 second, significantly faster than manual efforts, enhancing productivity.
Accuracy: Automation reduces the chances of human errors in document creation, ensuring consistent and reliable test design documents.
Efficiency: Simultaneous generation of documents for multiple tables accelerates the testing process and boosts team efficiency.
Azure DevOps Integration: The tool's integration with Azure DevOps allows for easy version control and collaborative sharing of the generated documents.
User-Friendly: The GUI interface simplifies the document generation process, making it accessible to team members with varying technical backgrounds.
In summary, the automated test design document generator offers a rapid, accurate, and efficient solution for the data testing team, facilitating the creation of multiple test design documents from CSV files while seamlessly integrating with Azure DevOps for enhanced collaboration and version control.

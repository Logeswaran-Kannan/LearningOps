Subject: Gym Membership Cancellation - August Onwards

Dear [Gym Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to request the cancellation of my gym membership from August onwards.

Due to changes in my personal circumstances, I will no longer be able to continue my gym membership after the end of July. Therefore, I kindly request that you stop the direct debit for the month of August and terminate my membership effective from the beginning of that month.

I appreciate the services and facilities provided during my time as a member and would like to express my gratitude to the staff for their support.

If there are any additional steps or procedures required to finalize the cancellation, please let me know, and I will be happy to comply.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your confirmation of the membership cancellation.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
[Your Gym Membership Number (if applicable)]
[Your Contact Information]

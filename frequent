The requirement pertaining to the consumption of panel data in DAVE is currently in the design phase. We anticipate that the development phase will commence around the middle of this month. Consequently, it is likely that testing will begin during the last week of this month. You may consider starting your End-to-End (E2E) testing for panel data around the same time. It's worth noting that these dates are at a high-level, and Mitual will provide you with more precise information regarding the exact completion date of the development phase.

Best regards,

ðŸŸ  Data Received but Not in Expected Format (Detailed Summary)

Quote Request â€“ Cover Expiry Date Missing
During validation, we observed that the Cover Expiry Date field is not being populated in the sample quote request messages.

Expected Behavior: The field should be populated based on the quote effective date and policy duration.

Current Behavior: The field is blank in all received samples from SIT.

Remarks: As per the MuleSoft team, this requires a fix from the Athena team, since the data transformation logic resides there.

NBQ Message â€“ Unexpected Cache ID Population
For New Business Quote (NBQ) transactions, a Cache ID is appearing in the payload even though it should not be generated for NBQ messages.

Expected Behavior: Cache ID should only be generated for subsequent transactions (e.g., MTAQ, REQ) and not for NBQ.

Current Behavior: SIT payloads show Cache ID populated inconsistently across NBQ samples.

Impact: Causes confusion in data mapping and misalignment during validation of caching logic.

Correlation ID â€“ Incorrect Test Data Used
The Correlation ID in the SIT payloads is being populated with dummy test data values rather than a meaningful, traceable identifier.

Expected Behavior: Correlation ID should uniquely identify each end-to-end message flow and remain consistent across all related systems.

Current Behavior: Placeholder test data values are being used, breaking traceability across systems.

Impact: Impacts downstream data loads and traceability during integration validation.

Rating Response â€“ Response Type Field Incorrectly Placed
The Response Type field is not mapped correctly in the Rating Response payload.

Expected Behavior: The field should appear at the defined hierarchy level and follow the correct casing and structure as per the integration specification.

Current Behavior: The field is observed in lowercase and/or at an incorrect level in the payload hierarchy.

Status: Under investigation by the development and integration teams to verify the mapping logic and casing issue.

Rating Response â€“ Missing Radar Fields
The Rating Response message is missing several Radar fields that are defined in the updated mapping documentation.

Expected Behavior: All specified Radar fields should be included in the response payload for completeness of validation.

Current Behavior: The current SIT payloads do not contain these fields.

Status: White and Paul are reviewing the mapping document and working to align the payload with the latest specification.

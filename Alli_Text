add point , even such short notice of planned leaves  internal communication is must to plan things for backup and other pre requestics to answer client impact assement . without notfying how can we defend your short notice planned leave , if other team members start doing the same the impact will be high , please be responsibile. everything here maintained transparent . all the feedbacks has been passed reguraly my client to Nat and Anukul with transparent , happy to disicuss things trasparently


Despite repeated feedback, we’re still seeing short-notice planned leaves without proper internal communication or impact assessment. Even in such cases, informing the internal team is essential to plan backups and prepare for client queries. Without this, we’re left without a way to defend the situation—and if others start doing the same, the overall impact will be significant.

This continues to raise red flags with the client, who has already onboarded a contractor for your role as a backup. In an environment this competitive, where sustaining billability is a challenge, such gaps put your position—and the team's reputation—at risk.

We've maintained full transparency: all client feedback has been regularly shared with Nat and Anukul. If there’s any lack of clarity on responsibilities or expectations, please reach out to me or Nat. We’re happy to support—but we need you to take accountability and act on the feedback.

Despite clear guidance from the client, short-notice planned leaves continue without proper internal communication or impact assessment. Even if it’s planned, notifying the internal team is essential—so we can manage backups, handle dependencies, and be prepared with answers for the client. Without that, it's extremely difficult to defend your absence.

If others in the team were to follow this pattern, the overall delivery would suffer. We all need to act responsibly—especially in such a competitive environment where even one misstep can open the door to replacements. The client has already onboarded a contractor, and holding our positions is getting tougher.

Feedback has been shared transparently and regularly by the client with Nat and Anukul. Everything we do is under close watch. Let’s be clear—your availability, communication, and ownership need attention. We’re here to support you, but it’s up to you to take charge and act.

Happy to discuss anything openly—please reach out to me or Nat if you need clarity. Treat this with urgency.

RL19.4 – Azure DevOps Model Release Pipeline
Task 1: Test Design & Scripting – RL19.4 Azure DevOps Model Release Pipeline

Description:
Design and prepare test scripts for validating the Azure DevOps model release pipeline process for ingestion jobs (RL19.4).
Covers build deployment, rollback validation, and release approval workflow per the BICOE release standard.

Validation Scope:

Review DevOps pipeline flow for ingestion deployment (build, release, rollback).

Define test steps to validate each stage’s success and log outputs.

Cover failure scenarios (rollback, re-trigger).

Map scripts to Confluence release design.

Upload all test cases to JIRA with requirement traceability.

Acceptance Criteria:
✅ Test cases prepared and aligned to mapping & design.
✅ Scripts reviewed by QA and DevOps.
✅ Upload complete in JIRA.

Dependencies:

Release process documentation from DevOps.

Access to pipeline configuration.

DoD:
✔️ Test cases/scripts reviewed and approved.
✔️ JIRA upload completed.
✔️ Ready for SIT execution.

Task 2: Test Execution – RL19.4 Azure DevOps Model Release Pipeline

Description:
Execute designed test cases to validate the Azure DevOps release pipeline.

Validation Scope:

Validate successful deployment and rollback of ingestion jobs.

Check pipeline log messages and build validation.

Confirm deployment notification triggers and approvals.

Validate version tagging and audit trail.

Acceptance Criteria:
✅ All test cases executed.
✅ Logs captured as SIT evidence.
✅ Rollback tested successfully.
✅ No failed jobs without retry mechanism.

Dependencies:

Access to Azure DevOps pipelines in SIT.

Coordination with DevOps engineers.

DoD:
✔️ All tests executed with evidence attached.
✔️ SIT sign-off from QA Lead.

🟩 RL19.7 – Monitoring
Task 3: Test Design & Scripting – RL19.7 Monitoring

Description:
Design and create test scripts to validate ingestion monitoring and alerting dashboards (RL19.7).
Ensure test coverage for monitoring setup, alerting logic, and SLA thresholds.

Validation Scope:

Review monitoring dashboard setup in Azure Monitor / Log Analytics.

Define test data and triggers for alert validation (success/failure, delayed loads).

Document test cases for data quality and job status monitoring.

Upload designed test cases and scripts to JIRA.

Acceptance Criteria:
✅ Test scripts aligned to monitoring design and mapping.
✅ Test data scenarios captured (success, fail, delayed run).
✅ JIRA upload complete and reviewed.

Dependencies:

Access to monitoring dashboards.

SLA threshold definitions from DevOps.

DoD:
✔️ All test scripts reviewed and uploaded.
✔️ Ready for execution phase.

Task 4: Test Execution – RL19.7 Monitoring

Description:
Execute monitoring validation scripts to confirm job health tracking and alert accuracy.

Validation Scope:

Trigger ingestion job success/failure scenarios.

Validate dashboard refresh, job count, and SLA breach alerts.

Confirm email/slack notifications received as configured.

Validate alert logs stored in monitoring DB.

Acceptance Criteria:
✅ Monitoring dashboards show correct job status.
✅ Alerts generated for failures/delays.
✅ Evidence (screenshots, alert logs) captured in JIRA.
✅ No high/critical monitoring gaps.

Dependencies:

SIT access to Azure Monitor.

DevOps setup of alerting channels.

DoD:
✔️ Monitoring validated across ingestion jobs.

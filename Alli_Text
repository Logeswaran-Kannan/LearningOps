Despite repeated feedback, we’re still seeing short-notice planned leaves without proper internal communication or impact assessment. Even in such cases, informing the internal team is essential to plan backups and prepare for client queries. Without this, we’re left without a way to defend the situation—and if others start doing the same, the overall impact will be significant.

This continues to raise red flags with the client, who has already onboarded a contractor for your role as a backup. In an environment this competitive, where sustaining billability is a challenge, such gaps put your position—and the team's reputation—at risk.

We've maintained full transparency: all client feedback has been regularly shared with Nat and Anukul. If there’s any lack of clarity on responsibilities or expectations, please reach out to me or Nat. We’re happy to support—but we need you to take accountability and act on the feedback.

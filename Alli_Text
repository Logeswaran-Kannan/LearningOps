From the BICoE testing side, we can confirm that the files generated by Sapiens are available in the shared folder and have been successfully loaded into the SIT Blob Storage.

However, the data currently available in the Blob Storage is from 10 December onwards, whereas the Viktor team has indicated a preference to use files generated prior to 10 December for quote cache deletion testing.

Could you please arrange to load the pre-10 December Sapiens-generated files into the SIT Blob Storage as well, so that the requested testing can be carried out?

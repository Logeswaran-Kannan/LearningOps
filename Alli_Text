Subject: Meeting to Discuss CDA Data Load Status and Testing Timeline

Hi [Name],

Hope youâ€™re doing well.
Could we set up a short call with the development team to review the CDA data load status, confirm the system testing start date, and discuss any current blockers, next steps, or dependencies that might impact the testing timeline?

Please let me know your availability so we can schedule a convenient time.

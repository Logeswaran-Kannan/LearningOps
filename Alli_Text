Rephrase in casual conversation - Is that because of this manual intervention not resumes from where it's left off or views missing issue.
ChatGPT said:
Here’s a more casual rephrasing of your sentence:

"Is that happening because the manual step doesn’t pick up where it left off, or is it more of a missing views issue?"

Would you like me to give you a few alternative phrasings too, so you can pick the one that feels most natural for your context?

Developer replied -  it's worse than that . ADF is deleted the previously data by skipping few tasks. We also have a scenario where there are some stored procs on the ref database that are stuck as the database is running at 100%.  - I need reaction reply in fun way
ChatGPT said:
Here are a few lighthearted/fun reaction replies you could use back to the developer’s update:

"Oh wow… so it’s not just raining, it’s a full-on hurricane 🌪️😂"

"That’s not a bug, that’s ADF going full Thanos—just deleting half the data 💀"

"Sounds like the database is on a coffee break ☕ but forgot to come back."

"Welp, that escalated quickly… guess we’re speedrunning chaos mode 🚀🔥"

Want me to make a few more in a professional-but-still-funny tone (good for work chat), or keep it fully meme-style?

You said:
Rephrase in casual conversation -noticed following columns are removed compare to pre benchmark, believe these columns are not anymore in Read replica and impact perspective these are ext tables so won't be much downstream impact I believe 
ChatGPT said:
Here’s a smoother, casual version of your sentence:

"Hey, I noticed a few columns are missing compared to the pre-benchmark. Looks like they’re no longer in the read replica. From an impact perspective, since these are external tables, I don’t think there’ll be much downstream impact."

Want me to also make it even shorter and more chatty, like for a quick Slack/Teams message?

Force kill eddge browser taks using the cmd 
ChatGPT said:
You can force-kill all Microsoft Edge processes from the command line using this command:

taskkill /F /IM msedge.exe /T
Explanation:

taskkill → Windows command to terminate tasks.

/F → Forces the process to terminate.

/IM msedge.exe → Specifies the process name (Edge).

/T → Kills the process and any child processes.

⚠️ Heads up: This will close all open Edge windows and tabs immediately without saving anything.

Do you want me to also give you a PowerShell one-liner version?

You said:
Edge browser is too slow even for two tabs showing memory error
ChatGPT said:
Got it — that’s frustrating when Edge eats memory like that 😅. Here are a few things you can try to fix the slowdown and memory errors:

🔧 Quick Fixes
Restart Edge completely
Run this in CMD to kill everything cleanly:

taskkill /F /IM msedge.exe /T
Then reopen with only the tabs you need.

Clear cache / browsing data

Go to edge://settings/clearBrowserData

Choose Cached images and files + Cookies → Clear.

Disable unnecessary extensions
Some extensions hog memory. Open edge://extensions/ and toggle off the ones you don’t use often.

Turn on Efficiency Mode

Go to edge://settings/system

Enable Efficiency mode (reduces background memory/CPU usage).

🖥️ System-Level Checks
Check memory usage: Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc → open Task Manager → see if Edge really is the culprit or if something else is spiking RAM.

Update Edge: Sometimes memory leaks are patched in newer builds. Go to edge://settings/help.

Scan for malware: High resource usage can also come from background junkware.

🚀 Extra Tip
If you’re just keeping tabs for later, try Collections (built into Edge) or use an extension like OneTab — helps free memory while saving your links.

👉 Do you want me to also give you a script (PowerShell or CMD) that auto-kills Edge when memory usage crosses a threshold, so it doesn’t freeze up your system?

How to check memory usage based on cmd
ChatGPT said:
You can check memory usage directly in CMD using built-in tools. Here are a couple of useful ways:

1. Check system memory usage
systeminfo | find "Available Physical Memory"
systeminfo | find "Total Physical Memory"
👉 Shows how much RAM is free vs total.

Or use:

wmic OS get FreePhysicalMemory,TotalVisibleMemorySize /Value
👉 Returns values in KB (you can divide by 1024 for MB).

2. Check per-process memory usage
tasklist
👉 Lists all running processes with memory usage.

For just Edge:

tasklist /FI "IMAGENAME eq msedge.exe"
3. Sort by highest memory usage
tasklist /FI "STATUS eq running" /FI "MEMUSAGE gt 100000" /NH /FO TABLE
👉 Shows only tasks using 100MB+ RAM. Adjust the number as needed.

⚡ If you want a real-time view like Task Manager but inside CMD, you can also run:

resmon
or

perfmon /res
(which opens Resource Monitor).

Do you want me to give you a PowerShell one-liner too that shows the top 10 memory-hogging processes in a clean table?

You said:
What is msedgewebview
ChatGPT said:
Great question 👍

msedgewebview2.exe (Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime) is a process related to Microsoft Edge.

📌 What it is
It’s part of WebView2, a runtime that allows Windows apps to embed web content (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) using the same engine that Edge uses (Chromium-based).

Instead of apps building their own browser engines, they can rely on WebView2 to display things like help pages, dashboards, or even full web apps inside a native Windows app.

📌 Why you see it running
Many Microsoft apps (e.g., Teams, Outlook, Office, Widgets, PowerToys) rely on it.

Third-party apps can also use it to show web content.

That’s why it often runs in the background even if you haven’t opened Edge yourself.

📌 Safe to remove?
You shouldn’t uninstall WebView2 Runtime. Lots of apps depend on it, and removing it may break parts of Windows or apps that rely on it.

If it’s using too much memory/CPU, it’s usually because the app calling it is heavy (like Teams) — killing the process may temporarily stop that app’s web features.

👉 Would you like me to also show you how to check which app is using msedgewebview2.exe on your system, so you know what’s actually behind the resource usage?

You said:
I see lot of msedge .exe console tasks but I just opened only 4 tabs
ChatGPT said:
Yep — that’s normal behavior, though it can look confusing 🙂

🖥️ Why so many msedge.exe processes?
Microsoft Edge (like Chrome, since it’s Chromium-based) runs on a multi-process architecture:

1 process per tab → Each tab is isolated, so if one crashes, the whole browser doesn’t go down.

Renderer processes → Each webpage gets its own renderer for security (sandboxing) and stability.

Utility processes → Things like GPU acceleration, networking, extensions, and background tasks also spin up their own processes.

Preloading → Edge may preload a new tab process before you even open it to make browsing feel faster.

So, even if you only have 4 tabs open, it’s common to see 10–20 Edge processes in Task Manager.

🔎 How to confirm what each one is doing
In Edge:

Press Shift + Esc → opens Edge Task Manager.

You’ll see exactly which tab, extension, or background task each process belongs to and how much memory/CPU it’s using.

In CMD:

tasklist /FI "IMAGENAME eq msedge.exe"
In PowerShell:

Get-Process msedge | Select-Object Id, ProcessName, CPU, PM, WS
⚡ What you can do if memory is high
Turn on Efficiency Mode → edge://settings/system → toggle Efficiency Mode.

Disable tab preloading → edge://settings/startup → turn off “Startup boost” and “Continue running background extensions and apps.”

Close heavy extensions (from edge://extensions/).

Use Sleeping Tabs → Edge auto-pauses inactive tabs to save memory.

👉 Do you want me to give you a one-liner script that will show you the heaviest Edge processes (by memory) so you can quickly see which ones are hogging resources?

How to clone job in databricks from one environment to another url environment 
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 15s
You can’t “clone across URLs” in the UI, but you can recreate the job in the other workspace in a few reliable ways. Here are the practical options (pick one):

Option A — Databricks CLI (fast + simple)
Prereqs

Personal access tokens for both workspaces.

Databricks CLI v0.205+ installed and two profiles set up, e.g. src and dst.

# 0) Configure profiles (one-time)
databricks configure --profile src
databricks configure --profile dst
1) Export the job definition from source

# Replace 1234 with your job id
databricks --profile src jobs get --job-id 1234 > job_raw.json
2) Clean the JSON
Open job_raw.json and remove/adjust things that are workspace-specific:

Remove read-only fields: job_id, creator_user_name, created_time, settings.edit_mode, etc.

Check each task:

If it uses existing_cluster_id or instance_pool_id, replace with IDs from the destination or switch to a new_cluster block that both workspaces support.

Make sure notebook_path/python_wheel_task/spark_jar_task references exist in the destination workspace.

Update secrets scopes/keys if names differ between workspaces.

Keep name, tasks, schedule (if any), email_notifications, parameters, etc.

Save as job_clean.json.

3) Ensure code is present in the destination

Best: use Repos pointing to Git so both envs pull the same branch/tag.

Or copy notebooks:

databricks --profile src workspace export_dir /Repos/yourrepo /tmp/yourrepo
databricks --profile dst workspace import_dir /tmp/yourrepo /Repos/yourrepo
4) Create the job in the destination

databricks --profile dst jobs create --json @job_clean.json
Optional: migrate permissions

# Get permissions from source, then apply to destination job id NNNN
databricks --profile src permissions get jobs/1234 > perms.json
# Manually trim principals and apply:
databricks --profile dst permissions update jobs/NNNN --json @perms.json
5) Smoke test
Kick off a run in the destination to confirm clusters, secrets, and paths are valid.

Option B — REST API (if you prefer curl/automation)
GET /api/2.1/jobs/get?job_id=… on source → sanitize JSON → POST /api/2.1/jobs/create on destination.
Same caveats as above (clusters, paths, secrets). You can also use POST /api/2.1/jobs/reset if you’re updating an existing job.

Option C — Treat jobs “as code” (best practice for multiple envs)
Use Terraform with the Databricks provider:

Define databricks_job + clusters/pools/secrets in code.

Have separate workspaces/variables for dev / stage / prod.

terraform apply in each environment keeps jobs in sync and auditable.

Quick one-shot bash helper (two profiles)
# clone_job.sh
SRC_PROFILE=src
DST_PROFILE=dst
SRC_JOB_ID=1234

databricks --profile "$SRC_PROFILE" jobs get --job-id "$SRC_JOB_ID" > job_raw.json

# naive sanitize (you should still review job_clean.json!)
jq 'del(.job_id, .creator_user_name, .created_time)
    | .settings' job_raw.json > job_clean.json

# TODO: edit job_clean.json:
#  - replace existing_cluster_id/instance_pool_id with destination IDs
#  - verify notebook/library paths and secret scopes

databricks --profile "$DST_PROFILE" jobs create --json @job_clean.json
Gotchas to watch for
Clusters/Pools: IDs are different per workspace. Prefer a new_cluster spec that both envs support.

Secrets: Scopes are workspace-local; make sure scopes/keys exist and names match.

Paths: Notebook/library paths must exist in the destination.

Libraries: If using wheels/jars from DBFS or Unity Catalog, ensure they exist in the destination.

DLT pipelines: Use the Pipelines API, not Jobs, to replicate.

Permissions & Run-as: Re-apply explicitly; they don’t transfer automatically.

If you tell me how your job is set up (cluster type, tasks, secrets, repos), I can draft a ready-to-paste job_clean.json tailored for your destination workspace.

Rephrase in casual conversation script in humanised tone - Mani I believe it's good to do quick spot recheck all the defects identified in test in production in data perspective, I believe it's quick rain check of 12 to 13 scenarios I believe. Also can you spot check valid_quoute column please I believe that is having downstream dependency with marketing team
ChatGPT said:
Here’s a smoother, casual, more human-sounding version of your script:

"Hey Mani, I think it’d be good to do a quick spot check in production on the defects we found during testing, just from a data perspective. It should only be around 12–13 scenarios, so more like a quick rain check. Also, could you double-check the valid_quote column? I think that one has a downstream dependency with the marketing team."

Do you want me to also make it shorter and more chat-style, like something you could just drop into Slack/Teams?

This appreciation emai mail for the release done from client as important release. As a contractor test manager I need to highlight this with my organisation in email to show my client leadership engagement our effective collaboration without saying explicitly in two para statement how the team is dedicated, and client called us tropper and established trust with client , don't go in detail about the validation and result rather as how client appreciate us. Also explain how it's benefits client business. Also request team to continue this for coming RADAR Live project as well 

Hi Steven & Akhil

I'm sure Paul & Phil have kept you up to speed on the implementation for GW Upgrade which has been a success due to the dedication and commitment from the team. 

This is just a quick note from me to express my thanks and gratitude to Paul, Simon, Gra-ham, Loges, Mani & Suraj for staying on up to 1am this morning to confirm test results on the data loads from GW cloud. Thanks guys, you are absolute troopers!

We've made some observations overnight and this morning which I have logged on this spreadsheet and reported centrally to Release Management to be tracked on daily calls for warranty. The team are working to resolve the urgent items (marked High) today as we speak.

Subject: Client appreciation for GW Upgrade release — momentum to carry into RADAR Live

I’m happy to share that our client leadership personally acknowledged the GW Upgrade release as an important success and called the team “absolute troopers” for going the extra mile through go-live night. Their note highlights the trust we’ve built and the way our cross-team collaboration shows up when it matters—visible, responsive, and aligned. This is the kind of engagement that strengthens our partnership and positions us as the go-to team when timelines are tight and stakes are high. The client’s appreciation isn’t about individual test outcomes; it’s about confidence in our people and the way we operate together.

Let’s keep that same standard as we move into RADAR Live. The credibility we’ve earned translates directly into smoother decision-making, faster adoption, and fewer business interruptions for the client—which, in turn, opens doors for deeper collaboration. Thank you to everyone involved for the professionalism and calm under pressure; let’s carry this momentum forward and make RADAR Live another delivery the client talks about.

Hi Hazel, hope you’re doing well! 😊

I was speaking with Anukul earlier — he mentioned he’d already spoken to you about the idea of getting everyone together for a lunch/dinner/drinks before the Christmas break. It would be a nice relaxed catch-up with you, Phil, Anukul, Mani and myself.

Since Phil is Bournemouth-based and Anukul is happy to travel, we were thinking Bournemouth might be the easiest place to organise it.

Before we look at dates, I just wanted to check with you first — do you have any plans to be in Bournemouth over the next few weeks before the holidays? If you’re already coming down, we can plan around that. Otherwise, we can find a date that works for everyone.

No pressure at all — just thought it would be good to meet in person before the year wraps up. Let me know what you think!

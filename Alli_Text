Subject: KT Plan for Radar Live Testing – Proposed Schedule

Hi Team,

As part of the Radar Live testing activities, I’ve prepared a short KT plan to walk through the key areas before my upcoming annual vacation. Please find the proposed schedule below:

Day 1 – 18/08: Athena Front End – Agent and Aggregator demo website test data creation process & E2E test data scenario walkthrough.

Day 2 – 19/08: Data flow process overview & high-level walkthrough. Demo data loaded in development environment in Databricks. Manual sample script walkthrough.

Day 3 – 20/08: Functional and NFR Test Strategy walkthrough, followed by Q&A.

@Munish – If you have some time this week, please join these sessions. Otherwise, it’s optional for you, and you can coordinate with Graham once you’re back from vacation.

Please let me know if these times work for everyone, or if any adjustments are needed.

Thanks,
[Your Name]

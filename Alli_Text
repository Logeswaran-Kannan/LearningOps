🟩 Task 1 – Test Design & Scripting – Motor Dimension Tables (Gold Layer / EDM)

Description:
Design and prepare test cases and SQL/Python scripts to validate the structure and population of Motor-related Dimension Tables within the EDM (Gold Layer).
Covers schema validation, mapping alignment, relationships, and business-key linkage as per the latest design document.

Validation Scope:

Review EDM design and mapping for all Motor dimension tables.

Define field-level validation – datatype, nullability, primary/foreign-key linkage.

Create test scripts for data completeness and referential integrity across related facts (Quote / Core Risk / Rating Response).

Prepare negative tests – invalid keys, duplicate entries, or orphaned records.

Upload test cases and scripts in JIRA with traceability to requirement IDs.

Acceptance Criteria / Testing Requirements:
✅ All dimension fields covered in test cases.
✅ Scripts align with EDM mapping document.
✅ Peer review completed & approved.
✅ All cases uploaded to JIRA and ready for execution.

Dependencies:

EDM data model & mapping specs.

Access to Gold Layer EDM tables in SIT.

Sample test data from BICOE / Pricing QA.

DoD:
✔️ Test design reviewed and approved.
✔️ Test cases uploaded with traceability.
✔️ Ready for SIT execution.

🟩 Task 2 – Test Execution – Motor Dimension Tables (Gold Layer / EDM)

Description:
Execute the prepared test cases and scripts to validate the Motor dimension tables in the EDM (Gold Layer).
Focus on verifying data accuracy, referential integrity, and schema consistency across all Motor-related dimensions.

Validation Scope:

Execute validation scripts for Vehicle, Driver, Policy, Proposer, Cover, and Core Risk dimensions.

Verify field-level accuracy vs mapping (spec datatypes, length, nullability).

Check referential integrity to fact tables (Quote, Rating Response).

Validate record counts and key uniqueness across dimensions.

Capture evidence (query outputs / screenshots / logs).

Acceptance Criteria / Testing Requirements:
✅ All dimension tables validated without schema or linkage errors.
✅ Counts and key relationships match design expectations.
✅ Evidence captured and attached in JIRA.
✅ No high/critical defects open at SIT closure.

Dependencies:

Completion of Test Design task.

SIT environment data load completed.

EDM access granted for QA execution.

DoD:
✔️ All planned tests executed with evidence.
✔️ Defects logged and resolved/accepted.
✔️ SIT sign-off obtained from BICOE QA Lead.

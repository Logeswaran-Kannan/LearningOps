Thanks, Nikki. I just spoke with Vijay — for the Athena interaction, we should be able to create a few samples tomorrow. I also have access, so if you’d like, I can create them myself as well.

For the Polaris side, it looks like some configuration changes are needed to create those in the same demo environment. I’ll follow up on that tomorrow and share an update.

In the meantime, Oliver and Shashi, I’ll set up a quick call tomorrow so we can go over the scenario details together.

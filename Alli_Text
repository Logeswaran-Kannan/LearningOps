Hi Dan, I’m good, thanks — hope you’re doing well too.

From the BICOE side, we’re handling component-level testing for PRECOM and Quote Request ingestion. A few defects have been flagged with the integration team. We’re currently waiting on integrated test data to start formal test execution — at the moment, we’re only getting NB flow data, which doesn’t fully meet our entry criteria.

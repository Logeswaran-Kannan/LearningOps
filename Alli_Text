Subject: Weekly Testing Update – Guidewire Upgrade & Radar Live

Hi [Boss’s Name],

Here’s my testing update for this week:

Guidewire Upgrade

Completed initial test strategy review with the development team – the high-level approach was shared and agreed. I will now document the automation approach and get it reviewed with the team this week.

The approach has been finalized to have two frameworks: one for Monitoring (validating current behavior with the read replica) and another for Data Quality checks (as part of a permanent regression pack for CDA cloud against the views).

POC for the Monitor framework completed; code development is in progress (tracking to 50% completion this week).

Coordinated with the dev team on pre-implementation steps for the upcoming production release, and I will be supporting the release activity remotely from India on 25th August.

4-week test plan has been shared with the team.

Also working with the IAM team to complete onboarding of Jeevitha’s access.

Radar Live

Supporting the initial ingestion test strategy for automation of MQS orchestration.

Knowledge transfer sessions ongoing with Graham and Munish.

Coordinating with the E2E team on BICOE test data scenario finalization.

Working with Oliver and Paul on enabling interaction data loads into the Event Hub.

Shared the UAT test strategy with the Pricing and E2E test teams.

Drafting test strategy for Blue/Green deployment – in progress.

Other Notes

Some items are completed, while others remain in progress for this week.

Upcoming leave planned from 25 Aug to 15 Sep.

Thanks & Regards,
Lucy

Hi Hazel, hope you’re doing well! 😊

I was speaking with Anukul earlier — he mentioned he’d already spoken to you about the idea of getting everyone together for a lunch/dinner/drinks before the Christmas break. It would be a nice relaxed catch-up with you, Phil, Anukul, Mani and myself.

Since Phil is Bournemouth-based and Anukul is happy to travel, we were thinking Bournemouth might be the easiest place to organise it.

Before we look at dates, I just wanted to check with you first — do you have any plans to be in Bournemouth over the next few weeks before the holidays? If you’re already coming down, we can plan around that. Otherwise, we can find a date that works for everyone.

No pressure at all — just thought it would be good to meet in person before the year wraps up. Let me know what you think!




Hi Hazel! 😊
Hope your week’s going well.

Quick one — Anukul mentioned he had a chat with you about doing a small get-together before the Christmas break. Nothing formal, just a nice lunch/dinner/drinks with you, Phil, Anukul, Mani and me.

We were thinking Bournemouth might be the easiest spot, and Anukul is totally fine to travel down.
Before I check in with Phil on dates, I wanted to see if you have any plans to be in Bournemouth over the next few weeks?

If you’re already planning to be down here, we can time it around that.
If not, we can pick a date that works for you — would love to have you join if you’re up for it!

Let me know what you think — happy to coordinate everything once we get your availability

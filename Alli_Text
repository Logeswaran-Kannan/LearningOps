That makes sense, thanks Nate.
I believe the renewal quotes will come through later down the line, but I’ll double-check with the application team just to be sure. From a testing point of view, we’ll also keep an eye on how the renewal quote part behaves.

Also noted on the ingestion pipeline and DLT process — good to know they’ll be running daily at 9am. 👍

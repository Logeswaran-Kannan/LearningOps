Collaboration between development (Nate, Mike, Oliver, Rob), design (Glen), and the testing team has really improved this cycle. Weâ€™ve formalized our test execution and defect creation process, and built a much stronger feedback loop for fixes. The increased collaboration and better understanding between dev and test have definitely helped us move faster, resolve issues more efficiently, and keep overall progress on track.

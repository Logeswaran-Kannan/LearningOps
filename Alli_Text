ðŸŸ¢ Jira Task â€“ RL21.1 Quote Cache Deletion Support Validation

Description
As part of SIT for Radar Live, BICOE QA will validate the Quote Cache Deletion process (RL21.1), ensuring Cache IDs are correctly deleted or persisted according to retention and deletion policies.
Validation includes checking consistency between Athena, MQS, and Blob Storage, confirming lifecycle rules are applied correctly, and ensuring no unintended exposure of expired cache data.

Validation Scope

Validate ingestion pipelines mark Cache IDs eligible for deletion as per policy.

Validate deletion process against:

Athena (source cache table).

MQS Cache data (message-level).

Blob storage persistence.

Confirm that expired/deleted Cache IDs are not visible in downstream reporting or EDM views.

Validate referential integrity â†’ Cache deletion should not break linked Quote IDs or interaction chains.

Validate time travel queries â†’ ensure historical cache data can still be audited where required.

Validate error handling when attempting to delete non-existent or invalid Cache IDs.

Confirm compliance with data governance and retention requirements.

Acceptance Criteria / Testing Requirements

âœ… Cache IDs marked for deletion validated against retention rules.

âœ… Deleted Cache IDs removed from Athena, MQS, and blob storage as per design.

âœ… Blob storage persistence validated for archived/deleted Cache IDs (where applicable).

âœ… Referential integrity validated (Quote chain not broken by deletion).

âœ… Time travel queries confirm auditability of historical Cache IDs.

âœ… Negative scenarios validated (invalid or duplicate Cache IDs).

âœ… Test evidence captured and attached in Jira.

âœ… No high/critical issues remain before SIT sign-off.

Dependencies

Definition of Done (DoD)

Quote Cache Deletion validated across Athena, MQS, and blob storage.

Auditability of deleted Cache IDs confirmed with time travel queries.

Referential integrity maintained for linked quotes.

Negative scenarios executed and passed.

Compliance validated and signed off.

No high-severity defects open.

SIT sign-off note shared with stakeholders.

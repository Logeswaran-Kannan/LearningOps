Is that happening because the manual step doesn’t pick up where it left off, or is it more of a missing views issue?
, I noticed a few columns are missing compared to the pre-benchmark. Looks like they’re no longer in the read replica. From an impact perspective, since these are external tables, I don’t think there’ll be much downstream impact
Yeah, makes sense — this is expected. Those columns already exist, so ODS keeps them even though they’re not in RR. That’s why ods_stg_copy doesn’t have them. We saw the same thing in test, so all good — it’s expected

That makes sense — I believe the renewal quotes will come through later down the line, but I’ll double-check with the application team to confirm. From a testing perspective, we’ll keep an eye on how the renewal quote side behaves.

The team also noted a couple of column-mapping issues, so we’ll recheck those after this post-load.

And noted on the ingestion pipeline and DLT process — good to know they’ll be running daily at 9am. 👍

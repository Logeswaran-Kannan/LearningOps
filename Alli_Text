Collaboration between development (Nate, Mike, Oliver, Rob), design (Glen), and the testing team has really improved this cycle. We’ve formalized our test execution and defect creation process, and built a much stronger feedback loop for fixes. The increased collaboration and better understanding between dev and test have definitely helped us move faster, resolve issues more efficiently, and keep overall progress on track.


The architecture-level discussion with Nikki and Nitta really helped clarify the MVP scope and gave us a better understanding of the level of testing needed for each area. Nikki’s input during the test strategy review was especially helpful — it gave good visibility on how our testing aligns with the overall project delivery goals.

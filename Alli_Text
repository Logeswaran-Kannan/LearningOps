The test data that has already been sent will not be lost. Messages are retained in Event Hub for 7 days, so they will remain available for consumption during that retention window.

Once the pipeline is fully set up and running, it will read from Event Hub and automatically ingest the queued messages. There should be no need for the tester to redo the testing, provided we bring the pipeline online within the retention period.

We’ll confirm once the ingestion has successfully completed.

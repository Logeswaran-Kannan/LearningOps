ðŸŸ¢ Jira Task â€“ RL21.2 Store Cache ID File to Blob Storage Validation

Description
As part of SIT for Radar Live, BICOE QA will validate the storage of Quote Cache ID files in Blob Storage (RL21.2).
The validation will ensure that Cache IDs are correctly extracted, persisted in Blob Storage according to retention and access policies, and auditable for downstream reporting or compliance requirements.
Testing will cover file creation, storage, retention, access control, lineage, and reconciliation against MQS/Athena sources.

Validation Scope

Validate that Cache ID files are generated and stored in Blob Storage correctly.

Confirm schema/format of Cache ID files in Blob matches design specification (e.g., JSON/Parquet).

Validate referential integrity â†’ stored Cache IDs remain consistent with Quote ID, Interaction ID, and linked journeys.

Perform reconciliation of Blob-stored Cache IDs with:

MQS messages.

Athena source cache tables.

Validate retention and archival rules â†’ Cache ID files stored for correct duration, deleted or archived as per policy.

Validate access controls (RBAC/PV groups) for Blob Storage â†’ Pricing, UW, Engineering.

Negative testing: attempt to access or modify restricted Cache ID files with unauthorized roles.

Validate audit logs capture file creation, access, and deletion events.

Validate Blob Storage resilience (large file, corrupted write, retry handling).

Acceptance Criteria / Testing Requirements

âœ… Cache ID files stored in Blob as per design (schema/format validated).

âœ… Referential integrity maintained (Cache ID â†” Quote ID â†” Interaction ID).

âœ… Reconciliation with MQS/Athena successful.

âœ… Retention and archival validated (expiry/deletion confirmed).

âœ… Access controls enforced (positive & negative testing).

âœ… Audit logs confirm file creation, access, and deletion events.

âœ… Negative scenarios tested (unauthorized access, invalid file handling).

âœ… SIT evidence captured and attached in Jira.

âœ… No high/critical issues open at SIT sign-off.

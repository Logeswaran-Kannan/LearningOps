Hey, just to add — we’ve already captured the scenarios for later test data creation. The current MQS precomp data isn’t real test data; it’s just what the E2E team built using the SOAP UI method for component testing.

Since SIT isn’t ready, they’re using this workaround for now, but it’s pretty time-consuming. They’ll start creating Polaris data tomorrow, and once that’s done, I’ll ask them to generate proper test data.

The main challenge right now is the manual, slow data setup until SIT is up.

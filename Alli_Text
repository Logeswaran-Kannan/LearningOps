🟢 Risks to Testing Timelines (Casual Style)

Our plan assumes BICOE is only doing technical validation — checking system behaviour, storage, and processing against design/mapping. We’re not validating the correctness of data generated by source systems.

A few requirements are still not finalised — if they change or get added later, they could impact the timeline.

We’re dependent on upstream teams — if their defects aren’t fixed or their test cycles slip, it can cascade into our plan.

The defect turnaround time is another risk — if fixes take too long, it could delay our test closure.

Reconciliation and data harmonization support for Pricing/UAT needs a clear process — without that, timelines could drag.

Any design changes or change control requests mid-cycle will impact our testing scope and plan.

⚠️ Additional Risks

Environment stability – frequent outages, refreshes, or environment conflicts can block test execution.

Test data readiness – if required scenarios aren’t available (NB, MTA, Renewal, Declines), coverage and timelines will be at risk.

Access issues – delays in getting access to Event Hub, Blob, or EDM views could slow testing progress.

Cross-team dependencies – BICOE needs timely inputs from Data Engineering, Pricing QA, and E2E to progress smoothly.

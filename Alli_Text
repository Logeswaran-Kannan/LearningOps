Teams Message to Hazel (polite, positive, gentle encouragement)

Sorry Hazel — Teams forced me to restart my system just as I was typing my reply.

And thank you for letting me know. I completely understand how busy things are for you right now, especially with Radar Live and your upcoming travel.

Just to share the background — the idea was mainly for Anukul to finally meet everyone in person. He hasn’t met any of us face-to-face yet (including Mani and myself), so he was keen to catch up informally before or after the holidays.

There’s absolutely no pressure at all, but if at any point — even in the New Year — you happen to be in Bournemouth or at the London office, I’d be really happy to arrange something around your schedule. We’d really value having you there, so we can plan it whenever it’s convenient for you.

For now, I’ll speak with Phil separately and see what might work.
And again, totally understand — thanks for being so open about it. 😊



Sorry Hazel, Teams forced me to restart just now — only seeing your message properly again.

And no worries at all, I completely understand. It’s a very busy period for everyone, especially with Radar Live and your travel plans coming up.

Just to share a bit of context — Anukul was really hoping to meet everyone in person at least once, as he hasn’t actually met any of us face to face yet (me and Mani included). So it was more of a small, informal meet-and-say-hello rather than anything big.

But honestly, there’s absolutely no rush. We can easily look at something in the new year or whenever you're next planning to be in Bournemouth or the London office. Whatever works best for you — we’re happy to work around your timeline.

I’ll speak with Phil and the others, and we can arrange it in a way that’s comfortable for everyone. Thanks again for letting me know, and really appreciate your time. 😊

Thanks for letting me know, and honestly no worries at all. I completely understand how busy things are at the moment, especially with Radar Live and your travel coming up.

It would have been lovely to have you there as part of the catch-up — Anukul was really hoping to finally meet everyone in person since he hasn’t met any of us yet, including me and Mani. But please don’t feel any pressure; your schedule has to come first.

Whenever you do happen to be in Bournemouth next year, or even if you’re planning a day in the London office, just let me know and I’ll happily arrange something around whatever works best for you. You’re still very much at the centre of this if we can make it happen at a later time.

In the meantime I’ll speak with Phil and see if we can do a small meet-up this side of Christmas for those who are free.

And thank you again — really appreciate you updating me. 😊

Hi Graham, good morning. Suraj is out sick today and Mani has taken a couple of hours off, so he’ll be logging in later. I’ll cancel today’s stand-up and instead schedule a session for the test strategy walkthrough on Automated CDA ingestion validation, so Mani can also join as part of the handover.

Hey, just got confirmation from Paul — all the views in the dev environment are built on top of the SCD tables, so we can go ahead with the initial testing. The only thing is the data is static for now, but it's still good enough to verify insert, update, and delete flows between the SCD and the new ODS views. Also, looks like boolean conversions are handled properly in the views (not just the latest flag). So it’s all set for now until real data lands in the test environment.

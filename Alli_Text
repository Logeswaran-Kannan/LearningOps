Yeah, it’s not directly used — but the two DV tables, PreComp Response and Vehicle PreComp Response, are populated from this table.
So, when messages are filtered out in the ehubstream table, the relevant vehicle information doesn’t get populated in those downstream tables either.

From what I understand, for the CoS view, we take basic policy data from the Interaction table and the related vehicle/proposal data from the MQS PreComp table.
In cases where policies are created via SOAP UI, there’s a high chance that while the Interaction message may have the basic policy info, the corresponding vehicle and proposal data in the MQS PreComp table might be missing if the correlation ID isn’t in the expected format.

Right now, for the SOAP UI-created samples, I’m seeing that the correlation ID isn’t coming through correctly, and the Interaction message isn’t getting populated either.
That’s why, in the current dataset, everything lines up fine — because it’s all application-driven data, so both Interaction and MQS messages are properly linked.

However, the front-end team mentioned that SOAP UI creation is also part of the production flow, so we’ll need to identify a way to detect and flag SOAP UI-generated samples on both the Interaction and MQS sides.
That’s my understanding of the situation.

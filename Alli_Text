The sprint officially kicks off today! 🎯
Please make sure you’re clear on what needs doing for the tasks assigned to you, including the Definition of Done (DoD). Remember — your tickets are your responsibility, so keep them in the right status at all times.

Our sprint goal is to successfully complete the 4-message validation up to the silversish layer through automation. QuoteRequest and PreComp are top priority — Mike’s confirmed the mappings are all up to date, and both Nate and Mike are ring-fenced to support testing.

If you hit any issues, don’t hesitate to raise them in the team chat. If we need a quick call or defect triage, I’ll get one set up depending on what comes up.

Starting today, we’ll be sharing the Daily Status Report (DSR) — so please make sure you give your daily progress updates without fail. I’ll rotate who shares the summary with the wider audience each day.

Also, if you’ve got any blockers, speak up in the daily stand-up straight away. Don’t stay quiet — it’s important to show your active contribution for project billing. There’s already a concern about the dev-to-test ratio (1:4), so let’s make sure our dependencies are managed properly.

If you need any suggestions or help, just shout — we’ll figure it out together. 🤝

For this sprint, Mani and I are at 50% capacity, and Jeevitha and Rahul at 70%, so the tasks have been allocated accordingly based on everyone’s leave plans. Please don’t keep tasks “in progress” till the last day — if you need any clarifications, ask early.

Test Strategy – Data Reconciliation of Quote ID between Source, MQS, and Interaction

Description:

This task covers defining and documenting the test strategy for data reconciliation of Quote IDs across Source systems, MQS messages, and Interaction data.
The objective is to ensure consistent and traceable Quote identifiers across all data hops within the Radar Live architecture — from event ingestion to final persistence in the data platform.

The strategy will outline the approach, scope, methodology, and validation techniques for reconciling data between upstream (Athena/Source), MQS payloads (Quote Request, Rating Response, PreComp, etc.), and downstream Interaction tables in the Data Lake (Silverish/Silver).

Validation Scope:

Reconciliation Scope Definition:

Identify all entities where Quote ID exists (Source, MQS messages, Interaction tables).

Define one-to-one and one-to-many relationships between these layers.

Data Lineage Validation:

Map Quote ID flow from Source → MQS → Event Hub → DLT → Interaction layer.

Validate transformations and data lineage consistency.

Reconciliation Approach:

Define reconciliation logic using checksum or count validation.

Define SQL and automation logic for comparison between systems.

Identify tolerance levels (acceptable mismatches, nulls, duplicates).

Exception Handling:

Define how reconciliation exceptions (missing, duplicate, invalid Quote IDs) will be logged and triaged.

Establish ownership for resolution (BICOE vs Source vs MQS teams).

Reporting and Sign-off:

Define reconciliation summary reporting format (pass/fail counts, mismatch details).

Outline validation checkpoints for SIT and UAT sign-off.

Acceptance Criteria / Testing Requirements:

✅ End-to-end Quote ID reconciliation logic documented for Source ↔ MQS ↔ Interaction.
✅ SQL/automation framework defined for data comparison and validation.
✅ Data lineage mapping verified against design and Confluence documentation.
✅ Exception-handling and defect triage flow established.
✅ Sample reconciliation test executed successfully in SIT.
✅ Reconciliation sign-off criteria approved by BICOE QA and Data Engineering.

Dependencies:

Source (Athena) data extract or simulated dataset.

MQS payloads with valid Quote IDs (Quote Request, Rating Response, PreComp).

Interaction tables in Silverish/Silver layer with corresponding Quote IDs.

Confluence mapping documents for Quote ID lineage.

Access to required Databricks and Azure SQL environments.

Definition of Done (DoD):

✔️ Reconciliation strategy document finalized and approved.
✔️ Logical mapping of Quote ID across all layers validated.
✔️ Sample test execution validated in SIT.
✔️ Evidence of test strategy shared in Confluence / JIRA.
✔️ No open blockers for subsequent reconciliation test execution tasks.
✔️ Sign-off obtained from BICOE QA Lead and Data Engineering.

Deliverables:

Data Reconciliation Strategy Document (Source ↔ MQS ↔ Interaction).

SQL / Automation framework outline for Quote ID comparison.

Sample validation report from SIT execution.

Exception log / mismatch analysis template.

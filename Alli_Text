Subject: RADAR Live – Data Enrichment Tables Available for UAT Validation

Hi <Name>,

Hope you’re doing well.

As discussed earlier in **early December**, the **RADAR Live data enrichment tables** are now available in the **test environment** and the necessary access has been provided for UAT validation.

Could you please confirm that:

* You’re able to access the Databricks link
* You can see the enrichment tables and their data

It would be really helpful if you could also share any **initial observations** on the tables, such as:

* Table structure and column definitions
* Data fields and values
* Any concerns or questions around the **decompressed data**, data completeness, or consistency

### How to check the tables in Databricks

**Option 1: Using Data Explorer**

1. Open Databricks
2. Go to **Data** → **Catalog / Schema**
3. Navigate to the relevant database
4. Select the enrichment table
5. Use **Preview Table** or **Sample Data** to view records

**Option 2: Using SQL Editor**

1. Open **SQL Editor** in Databricks
2. Run:

   ```sql
   SHOW TABLES IN <schema_name>;
   ```
3. Query a table:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM <schema_name>.<table_name> LIMIT 100;
   ```
4. Review column values, populated fields, and decompressed data

Please let us know:

* If you’re able to access everything successfully
* Any observations or feedback on the listed tables that we should address

Your input will help us close out the UAT smoothly.

Thanks, <Your Name>

ðŸŸ¢ Jira Task â€“ RL19.x Vehicle Model / Area Factor Data Ingestion Validation (RL19.1 â€“ RL19.7)

Description
As part of SIT for Radar Live, BICOE QA will validate the full scope of Vehicle Model and Area Factor data ingestion (RL19.1â€“RL19.7).
This includes ingestion pipeline setup, data quality validation, logging/error handling, release process pipelines, data access controls, retention/archive handling, and monitoring.
Testing will confirm the ingestion solution is production-ready, resilient, and compliant with organisational NFRs.

Validation Scope

RL19.1 File Share in all environments

Validate connectivity, schema, and file share access across SIT/UAT/Pre-Prod.

RL19.2 Data Quality Embedded

Validate completeness, uniqueness, referential integrity, and consistency of ingested records.

RL19.3 Error Handling / Log Reporting

Validate ingestion failures generate error logs and alerts.

Confirm error scenarios (corrupt file, missing fields, invalid schema) are handled gracefully.

RL19.4 Azure DevOps Model Release Pipelines

Validate CI/CD deployment pipelines for ingestion jobs.

Confirm rollback/redeploy functions correctly.

RL19.5 Data Access Controls

Validate RBAC/PV groups for different roles (Pricing, Underwriting, Engineering).

Negative testing â†’ confirm restricted groups cannot access ingestion data.

RL19.6 Data Retention / Archive

Validate lifecycle policies (storage duration, archival, deletion).

Confirm time travel queries for expired vs active data.

RL19.7 Monitoring

Validate monitoring dashboards capture ingestion job performance, error counts, and SLA breaches.

Confirm alerts routed to appropriate support groups.

Acceptance Criteria / Testing Requirements

âœ… File share validated in SIT/UAT/Pre-Prod with correct schema/permissions.

âœ… Data quality rules executed successfully (completeness, uniqueness, referential integrity).

âœ… Error handling validated with test scenarios (corrupt, missing, invalid files).

âœ… Azure DevOps release pipeline tested for deployment, rollback, and redeploy.

âœ… Data access controls validated for all PV groups (positive & negative testing).

âœ… Retention/archive rules validated with time travel queries and expiry enforcement.

âœ… Monitoring dashboards validated for ingestion metrics, alerts, and reporting.

âœ… SIT test evidence attached in Jira.

âœ… No high/critical issues remain open before SIT exit.

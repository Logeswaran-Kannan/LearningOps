Subject: Update on Data Dependencies & Issues Impacting BICOE Testing (Post-CR041)

Hi Team,

Following the post-CR041 changes, we can now see the data flowing through with the modified headers. However, there are still several data gaps impacting BICOE testing. Please find the summary below:

1. Cache ID

Cache ID is not populating in most of the messages.
RL-1301 has been raised.

2. Quote Request

2.1 Vehicle Premium: Pre-IPT and Add-ons values are missing.

2.2 Cover details: Personal Accident 5K and Courtesy Car Total Repair not coming through.

2.3 Modifications: Missing (expected only via Aggregator flow).

2.4 Driver details missing:

Licence Validated Ind

Driver Medical Condition

DVLA Advised Ind

Driver Reg Disable Ind

2.5 Conviction: Disqualified End Date missing.

2.6 Policy holder details missing – please refer to the attached sheet.

3. PRECOMP Error Data

3.1 No PRECOMP error records seen in SIT. Need to investigate whether current data has no errors or if new test data is required.

3.2 Data profiling for Driver, Vehicle, Policy Holder, and Policy details is ongoing.

Nearly 400 columns need profiling, so this is taking some time.

We will share the outcomes once completed.

4. Rating Request

MyLicence data is missing, likely tied to an open issue.

RL-1300 raised regarding uppercase field name.

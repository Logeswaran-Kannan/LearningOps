I’m progressing the setup needed for the Pricing UAT users to access the required MQS data in the Databricks TEST environment. I now have all the ADM IDs for the UAT users, so I am raising the request to create the new PV group today to avoid any delay in UAT preparation.

Below is the access configuration I will be submitting, following the standard PV-group setup process and the MQS naming conventions.

PV Group Creation Details (as per request form)

Request Type:
Create New Group

Group Name:
PV_MQS_Pricing_UAT_Test

Application / Platform:
Databricks – TEST Workspace

Group Description:
Create PV group for Pricing UAT users to access MQS data views in Databricks TEST environment. Access needed to support UAT validation for Radar Live.

Add Members (ADM Accounts Only):
(ADM user list included in request)

Access Required:
Read Only

Schema / Folders Required:
mqs_athn_mtr_views

PII Restriction:
Non-PII access only

Business Justification:
Pricing UAT users require read-only access to MQS views in Databricks TEST to validate offline MQS data against the online systems as part of UAT.

Since both of you are currently out of office, I will proceed with submitting this request with non-PII access.
If any changes are required (naming, schema restrictions, PII requirements, etc.), please let me know when you are back and I can update the configuration or raise a follow-up request.

Thanks,

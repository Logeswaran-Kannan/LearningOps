Hi [Boss's Name],

Thanks very much for your review, feedback, and sign-off.
I’ll go ahead and make the necessary updates to the order of execution in those relevant sections as discussed.

Please let me know if there’s anything else you’d like adjusted.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

Cancelling today’s catch-up as it clashes with the testing weekly sync. Let’s reschedule if needed!

Hey, I’ve got a phone appointment today at 9:45 — would it be alright if I went first on the GW upgrade automation update?

Just a quick roundup from my side:

Test Plan & Strategy – Graham has reviewed it and shared feedback, particularly around the order of execution. I’ll be updating that section in the Confluence page accordingly.

Framework Development – The remaining parts, like Teams channel notifications and auto test case run capture in Azure DevOps, are now completed for the sample set. I’m planning a demo for the test team soon. Robert’s team is also keen to see this for the pricing project, so I’ll loop them in as well. With that, the automation framework integration is pretty much complete.

Test Design – Mani is working on additional test cases focused on identifying data anomalies and patterns. I’ve also got a call lined up with Graham today to finalise the scope of the Silver tables.

Test Data – I’ll let Suraj share the latest on this, especially around the ongoing discussions with Nick’s team.

Test Execution – Mani has started a mock run for the Oracle staging layer vs. ODS comparison. I’ll let him give more detail on how that’s progressing.

Blockers/Risks – The key risk to starting execution on 22nd April is the availability of the test environment and test data — both are still dependent on the Read Replica setup. I believe Paul and Hazel are actively following up with the Guidewire team on that front.

I won’t be able to join today’s connect as I have a medical phone appointment.

Quick update from my side:

Test Plan & Strategy: Graham has reviewed it and provided feedback, especially around the order of execution. I’ll be updating that section in the Confluence page accordingly.

Framework Integration: The remaining components — Teams channel notifications and automated test case run capture in Azure DevOps — are now completed for the sample set. I’m planning a demo for the test team soon. Robert’s team has also shown interest from the pricing project side, so I’ll include them as well. With this, the automation framework integration is nearly complete.

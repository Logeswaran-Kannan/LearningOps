Hi Vijay, I had a few questions on the interaction data – not sure if you’re the right person for this, but maybe you can point me in the right direction if not:

For the sample NB converted quote, I’m seeing about a 1-hour difference between the front-end start date and the payload received. Could this be related to daylight saving?

I noticed several converted quotes are sharing the same mqsQuoteId. I thought each quote should have a unique ID, except in the case of a requote – is that right?

In the annual payment case, the payment method shows as card, but the payment amount isn’t populated. Also, I’m seeing installment details even for an annual payment policy.

Let me know if you’re the right person to check with, or if I should reach out to someone else. Thanks!

PRECOM Response – Missing Error Details
It’s been agreed that Adrian and Jamie will share the SVC error detail messages needed for BICOE testing.

We currently have dependencies related to the Correlation ID changes. Adrian’s team has agreed to provide the filter format so that BICOE can identify SOAP UI–created messages on our side. However, for this specific Error SVC validation, we’ll need to avoid applying the test format for the External ID to ensure accurate component-level validation.

could you update the tracker with the % completion for the items you’ve worked on or are currently working on? Don’t worry about the planned dates for now — just use the actuals based on where things stand.

If you’ve created any related Jira tasks, drop in the task numbers too.
We’ll go through everything together in tomorrow’s stand-up. Thanks!

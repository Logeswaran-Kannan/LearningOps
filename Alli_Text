This defect relates to a mismatch observed between the requirements documented on the Confluence page and the actual data received in the vehicle model/factor files used for testing.

From the BICOE perspective, this is an additional observation identified during system integration testing. However, the fix and data ownership sit with the Pricing team. As discussed with Adrian Veal, this will be managed by Sachin Khareâ€™s team going forward.

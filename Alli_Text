Subject: Help Needed: Missing Data in SIT (Other Insurance & Vehicle Modification) – BICOE

Hi Alison & Team,

We’re seeing missing data in SIT for the following areas and wanted your help to understand what’s happening:

Other Insurance details (Proposer/Policy Holder)

Vehicle Modification details

We’ve already shared the element-level details with the relevant teams for analysis, as requested. From the BICOE side, these fields aren’t populating in the payload/tables we validate against, which is blocking some of our checks.

Could you please:

Confirm the source mapping and expected population logic for these elements.

Let us know if there are any environment configs/filters (e.g., data rules, feature flags, or conditional mappings) that could be suppressing these fields in SIT.

Share a sample payload (or table extracts) where these fields are expected to appear.

Provide an owner and ETA for a fix/workaround, or let us know if you need anything else from BICOE.

Happy to jump on a quick call if that’s easier—just suggest a time.

Thanks a lot for the support!

Subject: Clarification Needed – Missing “Other Insurance” & “Vehicle Modification” Data in SIT (BICOE Testing)

Hi Alison & Team,

Hope you’re doing well.

We’ve noticed that in the SIT environment, data related to “Other Insurance” and “Vehicle Modification” is missing from the messages received on the BICOE side.

From a business scenario point of view, these details are important because:

Other Insurance details capture whether the proposer or policyholder has existing or prior insurance policies — this impacts risk evaluation and quote accuracy.

Vehicle Modification details are used to assess non-standard vehicle conditions, which can affect pricing, eligibility, and premium calculation.

At the moment, these fields are coming through as blank or missing entirely in the SIT payloads. We’ve already shared the element-level details for reference, but it would help if your team could:

Review whether these fields are being captured at the front-end UI level during data entry.

Confirm if any UI logic, conditional fields, or validation rules could be preventing this data from being passed downstream.

Provide an example or confirmation of the expected data flow for these fields when the inputs are provided on the UI.

This information will help us confirm whether the issue lies in the front-end capture, integration, or downstream mapping.

Please let us know if you’d like a short sync-up to walk through the examples we’re seeing on the BICOE side.

Thanks for your help and support!

At the moment, these fields are coming through as blank or missing entirely in the SIT payloads.
We’re not fully sure under which front-end scenario category these elements are expected to populate — if your team could provide some insight on that, it would be really helpful for us to validate the correct data flow.

Subject: Clarifications on Quote Request Message – Requote Scenarios

Hi [Team],

Based on our recent revalidation, we have a couple of clarifications to confirm:

1️⃣ Our understanding is that for Requote scenarios, the control.transactionType in the Quote Request message should be 30, which we believe represents NB Requotes or MTA. Could you please confirm if that’s correct?

For NB Quotes, the control.transactionType should be 02, and the cache-data label should be ‘original’ rather than ‘current’.

However, we’re currently observing both NB Quote and NB Requote messages using control.transactionType = 02.

2️⃣ Similarly, we’ve noticed instances where a single cacheID is tagged with multiple MQSQUOTEIDs, all having control.transactionType = 02.

While we understand this can happen for Requote scenarios, we’re seeing quite a few cases where multiple MQSQUOTEIDs are linked to the same cacheID.

Could you please confirm if this behaviour is expected, or if any changes are planned on your end?

Thanks and regards,
[Your Name]

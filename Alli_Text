I was on annual vacation and out of network coverage, but I’ve just reconnected and submitted all my timesheets. I’m on leave this week; however, on the 25th (UK bank holiday), I was requested to support the release. The client has confirmed that this can be charged, so I’ve included it in my timesheet.

Please let me know if you need any further details from my side.

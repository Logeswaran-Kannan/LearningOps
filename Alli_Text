Subject: Help Needed: Missing Data in SIT (Other Insurance & Vehicle Modification) – BICOE

Hi Alison & Team,

We’re seeing missing data in SIT for the following areas and wanted your help to understand what’s happening:

Other Insurance details (Proposer/Policy Holder)

Vehicle Modification details

We’ve already shared the element-level details with the relevant teams for analysis, as requested. From the BICOE side, these fields aren’t populating in the payload/tables we validate against, which is blocking some of our checks.

Could you please:

Confirm the source mapping and expected population logic for these elements.

Let us know if there are any environment configs/filters (e.g., data rules, feature flags, or conditional mappings) that could be suppressing these fields in SIT.

Share a sample payload (or table extracts) where these fields are expected to appear.

Provide an owner and ETA for a fix/workaround, or let us know if you need anything else from BICOE.

Happy to jump on a quick call if that’s easier—just suggest a time.

Thanks a lot for the support!

Hey, just a heads-up — I’m updating a few Jira backlog tasks to adjust sprint details and some other fields so they align with the corresponding development user stories for each sprint.

You might get a few Jira email alerts during this, so please ignore them for now. Once I’m done, I’ll catch up with you to go over the updates.

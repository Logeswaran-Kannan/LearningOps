Hey, just checking — do we have any centralised defect triage process in place to raise data-level observations on what we’re receiving at the BICOE end?

If there’s already one running, could you please loop me into that meeting so we can formalise the defect reporting process? It’ll help us avoid reaching out to individuals separately and losing track of issues.

Hi Mike,

Based on the revalidation, I’ve got a couple of clarifications:

1️⃣ We’re trying to understand how to differentiate between an NB quote and a Requote. Our understanding is that for a Requote scenario, the control.transactionType in the quote request message should be 30. I came across a reference in the Mule document mentioning that 30 denotes NB Requotes or MTA. Can you confirm if that’s correct?

From what we see, both NB requotes / MTA should ideally have control.transactionType = 03 and the cache-data label as ‘original’ rather than ‘current’. However, in our data, both NB quote and NB requote are showing as control.transactionType = 02.

2️⃣ Similarly, we’ve noticed that a single cacheID is tagged with multiple MQSQUOTEIDs, all having control.transactionType = 02. That might be expected for a requote scenario, but we’re seeing quite a few cacheIDs linked with multiple MQSQUOTEIDs — which seems like it could be a source data issue.

Just wanted to confirm our understanding here — does that align with what you’ve seen?

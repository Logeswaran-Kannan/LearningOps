Subject: Action Tracker – Daily Progress Updates & Ownership Confirmation

Hi Team,

As discussed, I’ve walked through the upcoming 4-week plan with [Boss's Name], covering both Guidewire Upgrade and Radar Live activities.

Please find attached the tracker outlining detailed tasks, ownership, dependencies, and timelines for each of you.
I request all respective owners to:

Review your assigned activities carefully

Update the tracker daily with progress status on your ownership items

Raise any dependencies or blockers promptly

If you notice any misalignment in tasks or responsibilities, please feel free to reach out directly or flag them in the tracker. We will review and resolve these during our next weekly sync.

Let’s ensure we maintain clear visibility on progress as we move forward through this critical phase.

Thanks for your continued support and collaboration.

Only the defects need to be carried over to the next sprint — there’s no action required from our side. It’s mainly an upstream issue, so just some follow-up is needed. These defects aren’t linked to any user stories, and since they’re upstream-related, they’ll be out of our sprint scope. However, they do need to be resolved by the upstream team for us to complete test closure on our end. Hope that’s fine.

I’ve raised a defect to help control this in the SIT environment — it hasn’t been prioritised yet. I also found out that the Athena offshore team is running some tests in SIT, so I’ll follow up with them to get this under control.

I’ve looped you, Smark, and Mike into the defect triage meeting, and I’ll tag any BICOE-impacted defects during the triage call.

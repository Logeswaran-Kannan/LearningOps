I wanted to take a moment to flag a few concerns that have been consistently coming up — both from the client and internally — which I believe now need to be addressed more formally, and with urgency.

Despite repeated conversations, we continue to receive red flags around short-notice planned leaves, without prior alignment or impact assessment. This puts us in a difficult spot when the client questions us, especially when the internal team isn't aware and can't prepare accordingly. The guidance on this has been clear from both the client and the organization, and yet the same pattern is repeating.

To be transparent, this has started to affect client confidence in our ability to deliver consistently. Myself, Nat, and Anukul are all aligned on this, and honestly, there's only so much we can do to support unless the process is followed. We’re all on the same side, trying to maintain stability and representation in a very competitive environment.

Aside from the leave management issue, there’s been additional feedback around overall availability, clarity in communication, and the pace at which work is getting converted into actual deliverables. With the PI30 planning concluded and expectations from our side increasing, we really can’t afford to fall short — it impacts both our reputation and your role continuity.

To be candid, the client has already started looking at backfill options, and another contractor has been onboarded. I’m trying to hold your position, but that can only continue if we show visible change and commitment.

Please treat this note as a call to align — not just as feedback, but as an opportunity to course-correct. If anything is unclear around your role, deliverables, or expectations, my door is open. I’m more than happy to guide or support, as is Nat.

Let’s treat this seriously. The client is closely tracking everything now — including availability, VPN/network consistency, and output. I’m saying this because I want to see you succeed, but that will need proactive action from your end.

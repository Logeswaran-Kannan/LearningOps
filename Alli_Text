At the moment, because we’re still in the component-level testing phase, we’re simply updating the original test cases and not maintaining a separate history for reruns.

However, once we move into End-to-End testing, we will retain the original failed results as part of the audit trail. We won’t overwrite the initial status; instead, reruns will be tracked separately so the failure history is preserved.

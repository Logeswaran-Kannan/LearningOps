ðŸŸ¢ Jira Task â€“ RL23.1 Athena Interaction Data Ingestion Validation

Description
As part of SIT for Radar Live, BICOE QA will validate the ingestion of Athena Interaction Data from Event Hub into DLT tables and its correlation with MQS data.
The validation will ensure the Event Hub stream is processed correctly, Interaction records are persisted in the Data Lakehouse (DLT), and correlations with MQS Quote/Cache/Rating messages are accurate and complete.

Validation Scope

Validate ingestion pipeline: Event Hub â†’ DLT tables â†’ Silver layer.

Confirm schema mapping of Athena Interaction Data matches ingestion specification.

Validate linkage and correlation with MQS data:

Interaction ID â†” Quote ID.

Cache ID â†” Interaction chain.

MQS message-level correlation (Quote Request, Rating Response, Core Risk).

Validate handling of multiple interactions per quote (NB â†’ Requote â†’ MTA).

Perform reconciliation between Athena source messages vs ingested DLT Interaction tables.

Validate CDC/versioning for interaction data (time travel queries).

Validate error handling (corrupt/missing Interaction messages from Event Hub).

Validate retention and archival policies applied to Interaction Data.

Acceptance Criteria / Testing Requirements

âœ… CDC/versioning confirmed with historical interaction data accessible.

âœ… Reconciliation successful between Athena source and ingested DLT tables.

âœ… Error handling scenarios executed and logged.

âœ… Retention/archival validated per policy.

âœ… SIT test evidence attached in Jira.

âœ… No open high/critical issues before SIT exit.

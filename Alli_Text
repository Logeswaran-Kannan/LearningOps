Hi Hazel,

These are a few points coming to the top of my mind from a BAU changes perspective that we should factor into our testing and impact assessment:

Data quality rules may need to be added or amended without breaking the LRT pipeline logic.

Renaming of existing elements could impact downstream processes as our codebase is case-sensitive.

DLQ routing needs to be validated to ensure malformed messages are handled correctly.

Raw Enrichment dataset decoding should be checked, including handling of error responses from enrichment providers.

Changes to datatypes on existing payload elements may cause schema evolution issues and need explicit validation.

Backward compatibility must be confirmed so both old quotes and new model quotes continue to flow consistently.

Payload size changes could impact performance across streaming and BICOE ingestion layers.

Active/Passive model switching needs to be validated to ensure the correct versioned model is consistently used end-to-end.

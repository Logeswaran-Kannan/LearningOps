Hi everyone,
I’m Loges, the Test Manager from the BICOE team supporting the Radar Live workstream. We haven’t spoken before, but I’ve been coordinating the Databricks access required for your UAT activities.

Your access to the core_tst.mqs_athn_mtr_views schema in the Test Databricks environment is now active. Below are some quick steps to get started:

1️⃣ Log in:
Open the Databricks Test URL and sign in using your ADM account.

2️⃣ Navigate to the data:
Go to Data → Catalog: core_tst → Schema: mqs_athn_mtr_views.
You should see all the MQS views listed there.

3️⃣ Run basic queries:
Go to SQL → SQL Editor, select a SQL warehouse, and try:
SELECT * FROM core_tst.mqs_athn_mtr_views.<table_name> LIMIT 50;

4️⃣ Validate your records:
Filter using your UAT Quote IDs to review the offline MQS data.

If you have any issues accessing the schema or locating your data, please feel free to message me and I’ll be happy to help.

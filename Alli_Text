From a BICoE data-pipeline testing perspective, the environment plan is acceptable for phased testing, but not suitable for full parallel, isolated P4 and regression execution.
Any defects arising from ML Gateway sharing, Athena unavailability, or protected TEST clusters should be classified as environmental limitations rather than pipeline failures.

5. Suggested One-Line BICoE Comment (for email / deck)

“BICoE confirms the environment plan supports functional and partial performance testing; however, testing confidence is constrained by shared ML Gateway usage, Athena downtime, and protected TEST clusters, which limits parallel execution and full end-to-end regression coverage.

Just to confirm my understanding — with the current Athena MQS setup, we can perform MTA/MTC for Polaris-originated quotes, and only NB quotes are possible for MQS standard ones, right?

And once the switch-over happens, we’ll only be able to work with Polaris data (no MQS standard quotes), correct?

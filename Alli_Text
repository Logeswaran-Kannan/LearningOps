Subject: Tracker Update – Daily Progress & Ownership Items

Hi Team,

As discussed during the walkthrough with [Boss’s Name], please find attached/shared the tracker containing the activities and ownership items for the next four weeks.

Request each respective owner to update your item’s progress in the tracker on a day-to-day basis so that we can maintain clear visibility.

If you have any queries or notice misalignment in the tasks assigned, we will review and address these in next week’s discussion to ensure alignment.

I will be available next week to address any questions or clarifications you might have.

Thanks for your support and timely updates.

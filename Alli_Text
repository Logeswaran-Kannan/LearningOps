Subject: Offer for [Property Address]

Hi [Agent’s Name],

Thanks for coming back to us with the details on the loft tank leak and the repair proof — that’s reassuring and good to know. We really like the house and can definitely see ourselves moving forward with it.

Taking everything into account, we’d like to put forward an offer of £418,000, subject to survey. As first-time buyers with no chain, we’re in a strong position to move quickly and smoothly, which I’m sure the sellers will appreciate.

We feel this figure is fair given the history of the leak and some of the other bits we’ve noted around the roof and condensation, but it also shows our genuine interest in securing the property.

Happy to progress quickly if the sellers are on board. Please let us know how they’d like to proceed.

Hi [Agent’s Name],

Thanks for sending across the details and the proof regarding the loft tank repair — that’s reassuring and helps explain the ceiling mark. We really like the property and can see ourselves making it a family home.

That said, we’re still mindful of the visible roof dip and the condensation/mould patches we noticed. These will likely need attention, so we’ve factored that into our offer.

We’d like to put forward an offer of £418,000, subject to a satisfactory RICS HomeBuyer Survey. As first-time buyers with no chain, we’re in a strong position to move quickly once everything checks out.

We’re genuinely interested in buying and are keen to progress, so please do let the seller know we’re serious and would love to get things moving.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

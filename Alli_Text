Thanks, Vijay — noted.

If possible, before switching off MQS completely, could you please perform a few MTA and NB quote transactions so that BICOE can receive some interaction events for validation?

Also, once you speak with the developer, could you please confirm the expected timing of the switch-over to Polaris? It’ll help me update our development team, as they currently have dependencies on both data sources.

I’m also collecting a few specific scenarios that the team needs for validation and will share those with you later today.

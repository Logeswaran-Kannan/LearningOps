Collaboration between development (Nate, Mike, Oliver, Rob), design (Glen), and the testing team has really improved this cycle. We’ve formalized our test execution and defect creation process, and built a much stronger feedback loop for fixes. The increased collaboration and better understanding between dev and test have definitely helped us move faster, resolve issues more efficiently, and keep overall progress on track.


The architecture-level discussion with Nikki and Nitta really helped clarify the MVP scope and gave us a better understanding of the level of testing needed for each area. Nikki’s input during the test strategy review was especially helpful — it gave good visibility on how our testing aligns with the overall project delivery goals.


Hazel and Simon have been really supportive in addressing blockers and escalating issues quickly to the right teams, which helped us get faster resolutions. The work for each sprint is becoming more structured and formalized, giving better visibility on deliverables. It’s also made it easier to link and understand dependencies between tasks — overall, it’s been really helpful for team collaboration.


The upstream issue reporting process needs to be streamlined with the E2E team, and test data dependencies are affecting some of our test coverage. I think these dependencies are impacting everyone in the team, so I’m working with the E2E team to set up a testing workshop to get a proper process in place.

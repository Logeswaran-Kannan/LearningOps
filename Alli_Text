For the multiple driver and vehicle scenario — yes, it’s included in the MQS test data setup. When they create the data, it will include multiple driver and vehicle combinations. Once the order of the drivers comes through, we’ll review and confirm back.

Regarding the driver PRN part, I think this needs a discussion with Nikki, Paul L, and Mike. From what I’ve read in the document, the PRN format is expected to differ between Radar GUID and Interaction Polaris, so they’re not meant to align.

However, if the expectation is for them to match, then it’ll likely require some changes — something we’ll need to discuss further.

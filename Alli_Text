The downtime has now been completed. Jamie has tested data creation and confirmed that he’s able to see the data. I can also see that the MQS messages are being received in the Event Hub through the Azure portal.

I don’t have visibility of the Interaction Event Hub in the portal, so I’m hoping messages are coming through on that side as well. If not, please let me know and I’ll check with the team.

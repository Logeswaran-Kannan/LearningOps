Hi Hazel, thanks — I’ve got clarity now on the ownership. I understand that in transmittals he’s been managing the delivery process in his own way, and he probably isn’t comfortable changing that straight away for Radar Live. I’m fine with that.

I’ll let him start by introducing a minimal process — like getting things into Jira — and then slowly bring COS into the testing flow so everyone benefits. I’ll definitely pitch in and support, especially around automation and regression, so he might start to see the value over time. It’s still early for him to fully see the benefit of formalising testing in the process.

And I’m good with it — apologies if I overstepped anywhere.

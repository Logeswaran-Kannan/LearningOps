Message to Nita (background + clarification request)

Hi Nita,

I just wanted to update you on something related to the UAT preparation for the Pricing work.

To enable the UAT users to validate the data in the Test Databricks environment, we need to create a new PV group and grant them the correct schema access. I now have the list of ADM IDs for all the UAT users, so we can proceed with raising the access request.

Before I submit the request, I need to confirm a couple of points with you:

PV Group Name – Do we need to follow any specific naming convention from the Pricing/Underwriting side for this UAT PV group?
(My default suggestion is something like PV_Pricing_UAT_Test.)

PII Restrictions – For UAT purposes, should we exclude any PII fields or PII-containing tables from the users’ access?
Nate usually confirms the correct Data Restrictions and schema setup, but since he’s away until Monday, I want to ensure we set this up appropriately.

My plan is to provide access only to the non-PII Bronze views required for UAT validation unless you advise otherwise.

Once I have your confirmation on these two points, I’ll raise the security request and the cloud ticket so the group can be created and added to Databricks.

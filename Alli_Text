The current MQS precomp data isn’t real test data; it’s just what the E2E team built using the SOAP UI method for component testing.

Since SIT isn’t ready, they’re using this workaround for now, but it’s pretty time-consuming. They’ll start creating Polaris data tomorrow, and once that’s done, I’ll ask them to generate proper test data.

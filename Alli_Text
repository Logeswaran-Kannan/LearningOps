From Motor Insurance Business / Quote Journey Perspective

Validate Core Risk data flows correctly across end-to-end quote journeys:

New Business (NB), Requotes, MTAs (add/remove driver, replace car, etc.), Renewals, and Declines.

Confirm Cache ID & Interaction ID link quotes into a journey chain (original â†’ requote â†’ MTA).

Validate multi-vehicle support (1 policy â†’ multiple insured objects).

Ensure orphaned quotes and declines are captured with correct flags (e.g., null-premium).

Confirm business KPIs can be supported â†’ segmentation, risk factors, decline metrics.

Hi Vijay / Bilal — just checking if any new data has been created today from the Athena demo environment.

Also, for BICOE development purposes, we’ll need some Polaris data in the demo environment’s event hub.
Do you know if any Polaris data has been created and sent to the demo event hub recently?
Or roughly how long it might take to make the configuration change to start feeding Polaris data into the demo event hub that BICOE is connected to?

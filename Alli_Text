For the current component-level testing, we’re simply updating the original test cases when a rerun passes — we’re not maintaining a separate history at this stage.

However, for E2E testing, we will follow the proper audit approach:
we’ll retain the original failed results, not overwrite them, and create a separate rerun cycle so the full traceability is preserved.

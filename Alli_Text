Subject: PV Group Setup for Underwriting & Pricing UAT Engagement

Hi Paul Reid / Adrian,

As part of the Underwriting and Pricing UAT engagement, we’re planning to create a PV group in the test environment to provide access to the Radar Live Bronze tables in Databricks, where the offline RAW data is ingested and stored. This will allow the teams to reconcile the online data with the offline data during UAT, as previously discussed.

Could you please help coordinate and share the list of team members from both the Pricing and Underwriting teams who should be included in this group?

Thanks!

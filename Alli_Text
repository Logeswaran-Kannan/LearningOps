Thanks Hazel, totally understand — it’s a really busy time for everyone, and no need to apologise at all. 😊

Whenever things settle down in the New Year, we’d still love to do this if you’re open to it. If you happen to have any plans to be in Bournemouth or the London office at some point, just let me know and I can arrange something around your schedule.

Absolutely no rush — just whenever it suits you.

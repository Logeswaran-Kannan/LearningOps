ðŸŸ¢ BICOE Testing Scope â€“ Raw Enrichment (RL2)
ðŸ”¹ From System / Components Perspective

Bronze Layer â€“ Landing (MQS Quote Request)

Validate that MQS Quote Requests carrying enrichment payloads are ingested successfully into Bronze.

Confirm message metadata (compression type, schema reference, provider) is persisted.

Bronze Layer â€“ ODS Raw Enrichments

Validate decompression of enrichment data (e.g., Snappy â†’ XML/JSON).

Confirm schema mappings for enrichment metadata fields: Compression, Provider, Output Format, Output Schema, Driver PRN, Vehicle PRN, Dataset, Error Codes.

Validate error messages/codes are correctly persisted for failed enrichments.

Ensure lineage tracking from source â†’ ODS is captured.

Confirm enrichment data stays within ODS boundary (not propagated to DV/EDM).

ðŸ”¹ From Data Enrichment Perspective

Validate ingestion of enrichment data for supported providers (Experian, LexisNexis, CAIS, CAPS, CIFAS, NOC).

Confirm Driver PRN / Vehicle PRN mappings are unique and consistent across datasets.

Validate referential integrity: MQS Quote ID â†” Driver PRN â†” Vehicle PRN.

Negative testing â†’ corrupted enrichments, invalid PRN, malformed schema.

Validate audit trail â†’ enrichment payloads with errors flagged but not dropped.

Confirm alignment with contractual obligations (e.g., enrichment data restricted to ODS, no downstream processing).

ðŸ”¹ Access & Security (RL2.2)

Validate PV group access:

Data Hunting team has full access to raw enrichments.

Pricing has restricted read-only access (no enrichment processing outside ODS).

Validate RBAC enforcement â†’ users cannot access data outside their role.

Confirm audit logs capture all access attempts.

ðŸ”¹ Non-Functional / Technical Scope

Validate performance of decompression & ingestion (large files, high volume).

Validate error handling for compression failures or missing files.

Confirm retention and archival policies applied to Raw Enrichment data.

Validate monitoring and alerts are raised for failed enrichment ingestion.

ðŸ›‘ Out of Scope for BICOE

Correctness of enrichment data provided by source systems (e.g., Experian values, LexisNexis mappings).

Business usage or decisioning logic applied by Pricing/Underwriting.

Downstream DV/EDM consumption of enrichment (not in current scope, limited to ODS).

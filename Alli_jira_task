Hey, just a quick note — going forward, please avoid creating any new tickets without looping me in first. We're tracking efforts against a dedicated task list, and adding tickets outside of that makes it harder to manage and align.

If there’s a spike or something that requires extra effort, let’s discuss it first and update the existing task with the effort change where needed. Thanks!

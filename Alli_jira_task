 Functional Scope (One-line statements)
Validate successful ingestion of MQS Rating Request into the EDM (Azure data platform).

Confirm expected fields (e.g., Quote ID, Request DateTime, Product Type, Risk Type, etc.) are present and populated.

Verify Raw Rating Area data joins correctly with Rating Request via key fields (e.g., postcode, grid reference).

Validate all mapped Ref IDs (from Confluence) exist and align with business definitions.

Check rating inputs like DVLA match flag, Core Risk linkages, and Emerging Risk Zone mappings are integrated.

Ensure optional fields (as defined in the Confluence page) are handled properly when not present in source.

Validate that classification codes (e.g., RRA_001 High Risk) appear for applicable Rating Request records.

Ensure area codes, geo-zone IDs, and segmentation fields are fully populated from the Raw Rating Area feed.

üöÄ Non-Functional Scope (One-line statements)
Validate row-level completeness and record counts between Rating Request and Raw Rating Area mappings.

Ensure timely availability of enriched data from prior day by 9 AM for MI reporting.

Validate consistent data types across merged attributes (e.g., ISO 8601 dates, string codes).

Ensure new rating area attributes do not break existing MI reporting logic or filters.

Validate masking or filtering of restricted fields (e.g., internal use fields) per user group rules.

‚ùå Out-of-Scope
Accuracy of the raw area classification logic (owned by Pricing/Underwriting).

UI rendering of rating request or area scores.

Live quote engine scoring outcomes.

Policy administration logic or quote rules tied to area classification.

Real-time ingestion performance (focus is on batch availability for MI).

‚ö†Ô∏è Caveats / Assumptions
The MQS Rating Request and Raw Rating Area data are assumed to be version-controlled upstream.

The MI team only validates technical merging and data availability, not the semantic correctness of classifications (e.g., whether a postcode truly belongs to a high-risk area).

Any missing optional fields do not constitute test failure unless breaking downstream joins or filters.

Ref ID-based validation (as listed in Confluence) assumes mappings have already been finalized.

PII and internal business logic fields are expected to be obfuscated or restricted based on role access ‚Äî MI validates visibility rules only where applicable.

üìò Business Scenario View (MI Validation Perspective)
Quote Scenario	Expected Behavior in MI View
NB Quote	Rating Request record appears with rating area codes from MQS and Raw Area mapping
Requote	New Rating Request version exists, shares Cache ID, updated timestamp + refreshed area mapping
MTA	Area classification reflects current address or postcode at time of MTA
Unmatched Postcode	DVLA match flag = false, area fields may be blank or defaulted
Emerging Risk Flag	Flag is correctly shown if matched to a zone identified in Raw Rating Area config
Quote Errors	Errors captured if rating request fails due to area misclassification (if mapped in feed)
Segment-based Reporting	Reports segment quotes by area code, risk tier, or region using new MQS + Raw Area attributes

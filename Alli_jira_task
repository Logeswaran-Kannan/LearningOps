Radar Live – Client Discussion & Resource Effort Alignment

Body:
Hi [Boss’s Name],

Hope you're doing well.

Scheduling this quick meeting to walk through a few points from the recent client discussions around the Radar Live project. I’d also like to share an update on the resource effort involved and ensure we’re aligned moving forward.

Topics to touch on:

Summary of the client conversation

Expected involvement from our side

Current and upcoming resourcing needs

Any blockers or concerns to be addressed

Let me know if the time doesn't work for you and I’ll happily move it.

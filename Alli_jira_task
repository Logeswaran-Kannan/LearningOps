Just wanted to give you an early heads-up — I’m planning to take leave from August 26th to September 12th as my dad has a surgery scheduled during that time back home.

From what I foresee, the Guidewire upgrade should have settled into production by then, and for Radar Live, the testing team is likely to be entering the execution phase. I’ll make sure everything is lined up and ready from the testing side before I head off.

Also, from the week of September 8th, I should be able to connect remotely from India if needed — happy to support the team where possible while I’m there. Let me know if that works.

I don’t have any other leave planned before or after this period.

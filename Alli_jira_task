Following the data fix applied for pc_history and bc_history, we observed absolute duplicate records in both the test and production environments. The issue has been triaged, and the root cause has been identified — a fix is currently in progress. Once implemented, we’ll revalidate to ensure no absolute duplicates exist in both the ODS and ODS View layers.

We’ve also noticed some records from the Guidewire source are carrying special characters. These need to be cleansed appropriately in the target ODS layer to meet data quality and cleansing standards.

The decimal conversion issue has been addressed. However, in a few tables, we’re still seeing Databricks display errors or exponential values. This behavior also exists in the current production environment, and it's confirmed that it doesn't affect the actual numeric meaning. Based on that, we’re good to close this defect.

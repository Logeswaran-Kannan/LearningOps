Subject: Request for Discussion: Error Handling Scenarios Validation – Guidewire Upgrade

Hi [Developer's Name],

I hope you're doing well.

As part of the Guidewire upgrade project, we've outlined several error handling scenarios related to the PostgreSQL ADF ingestion into the Bronze ODS layer. I'd like to walk through each of these with you to:

Confirm whether these scenarios can be simulated in the test environment

Understand if any of them have already occurred and how they were managed

Discuss if fallback/mitigation processes are in place, especially where simulation isn't possible

Capture any gaps or risks to production for formal acceptance

Would you be available for a short sync (20–30 mins) this week to go over this? I’ll share the working sheet with details ahead of the call.

Please let me know your availability.

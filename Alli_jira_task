Yeah, I thought the start date would be something you and Anukul would finalize. From my chat with him last week, it sounds like Renjini Ravindran might be available from August 1st, but that still needs confirmation from Anukul. In the meantime, I’m planning to give Renjini some basic KT over the Cognizant network—of course, without sharing any material, in line with our policy.

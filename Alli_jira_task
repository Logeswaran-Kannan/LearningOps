Subject: Follow-up on Message Handling Test Assumptions Discussion

Hi [Recipient's Name],

Thanks again for taking the time yesterday to walk through the assumptions and clarifications around message handling in the silver load process — especially around out-of-sequence, late arrival, and missing messages, as well as how resending from the source side would work.

Here’s a quick summary of the key takeaways:

Message Resend Handling:
We discussed that there's currently no plan to store incoming messages on the source application side. The expectation is to log metrics, but this poses a risk if a reconciliation issue arises later and the source isn’t able to resend or reprocess the messages.

Test Assumptions Alignment:
Nate and Glen will start updating the Confluence page with the key ingestion-related test assumptions so we’re all aligned on what’s expected and what can be realistically tested during execution. I’ve shared the Confluence link below — if you could review and drop your comments on the relevant action scenarios, that would be super helpful.

Out-of-Sequence / Late Arrival Data:
We’ll need more reliable test data to better simulate and understand these scenarios. That will help us validate how the system behaves under such conditions.

Let me know if I’ve missed anything or if there’s anything else we need to follow up on.

Thanks again,

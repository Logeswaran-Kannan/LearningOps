Just a quick note — we have another tester, Shashi, joining the BICOE testing team to help out, especially on the vehicle area file validation side. To help us collaborate more closely and stay in sync with the E2E test plan, I wanted to touch base on a few things:

Could we get Vijay added to this group as well?

Since Shashi is starting with the vehicle file validation on our side, we’d like to understand how best to align with the E2E test scenarios for that process.

Is there an E2E defect triage meeting already running? If so, could you please add me to it?

Where can I find the E2E test plan?

If any testing workshops are already scheduled, I’d appreciate it if you could include me in those too.

Thanks a lot! Looking forward to working more closely with you both.

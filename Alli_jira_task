On the test strategy side, I’ve captured the technical test scenarios for the ingestion process all the way up to the silverish layer in the Confluence page. Planning to do a walkthrough with the team next week to get your feedback.

There are still a few grey areas around environment setup and platform alignment with the E2E test team. From what I can see, things are a bit delayed on their end—especially around test data preparation methods like SoapUI or alternatives. Jimmy’s managed to get something working for PreCom, but there’s an issue with passing request/response due to a datatype mismatch.

As Hazel flagged earlier, setting up connectors and defining a clear method for correlated test data prep is still pending from the E2E perspective.

In the meantime, we’re focusing on building up our in-house test coverage and getting the scripts ready for all six message types up to the silverish layer. I was also planning to start on the automation POC setup, but that’s been slightly delayed due to higher priority work on the Guidewire upgrade.

Will keep you posted as things progress.

 thanks for the note. Just to mention – my flight is on the evening of the 22nd, and the 25th is a bank holiday, so I believe most people might already have plans around that.

That said, I’m absolutely fine to support from the 23rd onwards from India – happy to help with the release and any follow-up issues after that. I’ll be flexible and available to support either of the dates, but just to note, I’ll be able to do that only remotely from India. No problem from my side on that.

Subject: Walkthrough on Radar Live Test Plan – Monday

Hi [Scrum Master's Name],

Just a quick note — I’ll walk you through the Test Plan for Radar Live on Monday, covering things from a test management perspective.

We’ll go over:

High-level test timelines

Test management setup in Jira

Workflow changes for defect types

Test dependencies and risks

Let me know if there’s anything specific you’d like me to include or if the timing needs to be adjusted.

Thanks,
[Your Name]

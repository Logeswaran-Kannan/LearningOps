BICOE SIT Testing Scope – Boundary Statement
BICOE QA is responsible for validating the integrity, completeness, transformation, and availability of Radar Live data (e.g., Feature Set, Rating Request, Core Risk, Rating Response) across the data platform – from ingestion in Bronze to structured models in Silver and reporting readiness in Gold (EDM).

BICOE does not validate the correctness of pricing logic, rule outcomes, scoring models, or business meaning of feature values generated in Precomp or Rating Engine – these are owned by Pricing QA.

✅ Example:
✅ In Scope: Confirm that the Feature Set field Drv_Age from MQS lands correctly in Silver with the right format, data type, and value for the given Quote ID.

❌ Out of Scope: Determine whether Drv_Age was correctly calculated in Precomp or whether it influenced the quote outcome properly — that sits with Pricing QA.

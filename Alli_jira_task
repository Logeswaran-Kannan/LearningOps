Just sharing a quick weekly wrap-up on where we’re at with testing – and big shoutout to the whole team for the solid progress this week!

We’ve got about 60% of the High-Level Test Strategy doc done so far. The plan is to lock that down by mid next week and go through it together for feedback and alignment.

The Test Plan doc has already been reviewed and is being updated by Amirtha to reflect the confirmed Day 1 scope, based on inputs gathered across the team.

On the test scripting side, using the sample messages shared by Mule for both quote request and PRECOM request, we’ve built scripts to validate incoming messages against the silver-ish layer. The scope for Bronze and Silver-ish layers is now frozen, and we’re working closely with Mike to finalize the scope for Silver and Gold layers, including any new or changed tables.

Had a good catch-up with Nate to walk through the current test environment setup and the orchestration process. Based on that, the technical test scenarios for ingestion and silver-ish validation are now finalized and currently going through review. Once that’s done, we’ll share it with everyone to get agreement and buy-in.

For the vehicle feed validation (file vs Cosmos DB), the test scenario is also finalized, and we’ll be reviewing that with the team next week as well.

To get better clarity on test data and data flow understanding, we’re planning to set up time with Asuthosh from the Mule team—should help us fill in any blanks.

Test artifacts delivered this week:

✅ Technical ingestion validation scenarios (for both streaming and file-based sources) – now under peer review.

✅ Sample test script for one message – smoke test successfully run.

✅ File-based validation scripts for vehicle feed – completed.

Hi all,

Here’s a quick recap of our testing progress this week – a solid team effort across the board.

📄 Test Strategy & Planning
The High-Level Test Strategy document is around 60% complete. We're targeting to freeze it by mid-next week and will walk through it with the team for review shortly after.

The Test Plan has gone through an initial review, and Amirtha is refining it in line with the Day 1 scope, based on input gathered from the team.

🧬 Test Scope & Scenario Coverage
Using sample messages provided by the MuleSoft team (e.g., Quote Request and PRECOM Request), we've developed test scripts to validate incoming messages against the Silver-ish layer.

Scope for Bronze and Silver-ish layers is now locked in.

We're collaborating with Mike to better understand changes to existing Silver/Gold tables and define the scope for those layers.

⚙️ Technical Validation & Environments
We had a detailed discussion with Nate on the current test environment setup and orchestration process.

Based on that, the Technical Test Scenario for ingestion and Silver-ish layer validation is finalized and currently under review. We’ll share it with the wider team soon for alignment and agreement.

🚗 Vehicle Feed Testing
For the vehicle feed ingestion validation (file vs Cosmos DB), the test scenario has been finalized. We’ll also review this with the team next week to ensure everyone’s aligned.

🧪 Test Artifacts & Execution
Test artifacts produced this week:

Technical ingestion validation scenarios for both streaming and file-based sources – currently in peer review.

Sample test script for Quote Request message has undergone a smoke run, with initial validation successful.

Vehicle feed test script for file-based validation is now complete.

🔍 Next Steps
Plan to set up a working session with Asuthosh (MuleSoft team) to get a better grasp of end-to-end data flow and fill gaps for test data planning.

Finalize the list of Day 1 tables and dependencies for scope clarity and timeline estimation.

Thanks everyone for the collaboration so far – great momentum and communication across dev, data, and QA teams. Looking forward to next week’s reviews and scenario walk-throughs.

Let me know if you need a version formatted for email or Confluence.

| **#** | **Validation Area**                    | **Test Coverage Statement**                                                                                                                 | **Expected Outcome**                                                                                   |
| ----- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1     | **Schema Structure Validation**        | Validate that each ingested message strictly adheres to the schema defined in the ingestion mapping document.                               | All fields match expected structure; no schema mismatch errors in pipeline logs.                       |
| 2     | **Mandatory Field Validation**         | Ensure all mandatory fields in each message are present and populated as per the mapping rules.                                             | All required fields are present; ingestion does not proceed if mandatory fields are missing.           |
| 3     | **Data Type & Format Validation**      | Validate that field data types and formats match the specifications in the ingestion mapping (e.g., date formats, number types).            | All field values conform to expected formats; no casting or parsing errors observed.                   |
| 4     | **Field-Level Mapping Accuracy**       | Verify each source field is mapped correctly to its destination field as per the mapping document, including renamed or transformed fields. | Fields appear in target tables with correct names, values, and transformations applied.                |
| 5     | **Null & Default Value Handling**      | Validate ingestion behavior when optional fields are missing or default values are used, as per business rules.                             | Ingestion completes with fallback/default values where applicable; invalid nulls flagged as errors.    |
| 6     | **Boundary & Limit Validation**        | Test edge cases (max/min values, character limits, etc.) defined in the mapping and ensure ingestion handles them correctly.                | No truncation or overflow issues; extreme values are handled gracefully.                               |
| 7     | **Duplicate Record Handling**          | Validate system behavior when duplicate messages are ingested (e.g., using unique keys like Cache ID or Quote ID).                          | Duplicate messages are identified and either rejected or flagged; no duplicate data appears in target. |
| 8     | **Reference Data Lookup Validation**   | Ensure fields linked to reference tables (e.g., DVLA, Rating Model) are enriched or flagged appropriately during ingestion.                 | Enrichment is successful using latest reference data; missing references are logged clearly.           |
| 9     | **Error Logging & Rejection Handling** | Validate that incorrectly structured or unmapped messages are rejected with detailed error logs.                                            | Rejected records are logged with meaningful error codes; system continues processing valid records.    |
| 10    | **Successful Load Confirmation**       | Confirm that successfully ingested messages appear in the Bronze layer tables with correct lineage.                                         | 100% of valid messages appear in Bronze layer; record counts match expectations from test data inputs. |

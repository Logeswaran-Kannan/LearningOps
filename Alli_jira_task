Test Data Comparison Summary: Motor Scenario (Legacy vs Cloud Versions)
PolicyLine Reference Mismatch
In the test environment, the PolicyLine reference values differ between legacy and cloud systems. This is likely due to each version generating its own line-specific references independently. Example: Scenario 6 – VehicleRatingFactor shows mismatched PolicyLine column values.
This variance may lead to data inconsistencies during switchovers or synchronization between environments.

PolicyLine Count Difference in Production
In production, the legacy version includes three PolicyLines, while the cloud version contains only two. This structural discrepancy could impact policy processing or reporting.

Renewal Transaction Coverage
The legacy sample lacks a renewal transaction in the test data, which leads to a transaction count mismatch. However, this is an expected and acceptable deviation.

Car Hire Add-On
The Car Hire add-on was included in both versions, and data matches accurately.

MTA – Policy Change (No Temporary Driver)
An MTA (Mid-Term Adjustment) was created in both systems.

In the legacy version, the MTA is in expired draft status.

In the cloud version, it remains in draft with a future effective date.
While the MTA status is consistent across systems, no temporary driver was added.

MTA – Policy Change (No Temporary Vehicle)
A second MTA test revealed the same draft status behavior, but no temporary vehicle was included.
The bound transaction data remains consistent across both systems.

Renewal Draft with Additions
A renewal draft transaction was executed in both versions. An additional driver and vehicle were added successfully and consistently in both.

MTA on Multiline Policy – Driver Count Mismatch
An MTA was performed on a multiline policy, adding extra drivers and vehicles. While most data matches, the number of drivers differs between versions, leading to a partial mismatch.

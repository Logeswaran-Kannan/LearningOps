Just a quick update on next actions from the defect observations:

For the CC_NOTE table, we noticed that in the ODS layer, data seems to be loading only from mid-May 2025, whereas in Read Replica, records go back to Feb 2025. Need to check what’s causing the delay in load.

We've seen three tables so far where strange characters (like the black diamond with a question mark) are appearing in the ODS output. Since they’re already coming from the source, looks like it’s on us to handle this cleanly in the ODS layer.

The bc_history table is still showing duplicates even in the incremental loads, which definitely needs a deeper look.

The priorpolicy table has a schema mismatch between Read Replica and ODS. We had a chat on this, and the agreed workaround is to manually align the schema metadata in ODS to get things flowing.

On the Frozen column’s downstream impact—we’re going ahead with excluding the view or adjusting the column mapping where needed based on earlier discussions.

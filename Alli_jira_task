That would be really helpful. I think part of the confusion may have come from some communication gaps, which probably raised questions about whether testing is actually needed for this. From what I understand, we haven’t officially committed to testing that part yet — it’s still in the early understanding phase based on this morning’s discussion.

In my initial chat with Oliver, he mentioned a few fields being added to an existing table. He explained it’s just a schema-level change and there’s no actual data involved at this stage. Right now, we’re just trying to figure out the E2E impact of this change.

At least from my end, after this morning’s call, I’m looking to get a clear view of what this change really means — and only then decide if any testing is required, along with what kind of data dependencies or E2E behavior we’d need to consider.

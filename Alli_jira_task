On the test strategy side, I’ve captured the technical test scenarios for the ingestion process up to the silver-ish layer in the Confluence page. Planning to walk through it with the team next week to gather feedback.

Other areas like test environment and platform setup – we’ve started initial discussions with the E2E team, but things seem a bit delayed, especially around test data preparation methods like using SoapUI. Jimmy has managed to get the basics going for precom, but there’s an issue with how the request/response is handled – seems to be a data type mismatch.

In the meantime, we're focusing on getting the scripts ready for all six message types up to the silver layer. I was planning to start the automation POC setup too, but with Guidewire upgrade taking priority, that’s been pushed out a bit.

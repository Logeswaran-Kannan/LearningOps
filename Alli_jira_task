I’m part of the Radar Live data testing team — I’m currently looking into the Vehicle Type data from Cosmos DB and was hoping to get some info on the configuration and connectivity side so I can help shape the test plan.

Do you have a bit of time today to give us a quick walkthrough at a high level? Mainly looking to understand the test setup, schema, how it flows through Databricks, and the source DB details. Let me know what works!

From the Motor side, we’ve completed validation for 7 out of the 8 scenarios. The one that’s left—Scenario 24—has been dropped from scope, as mentioned earlier. Aside from a minor observation related to the PolicyLine field, everything else is pretty much in line with the legacy format.

The small mismatches in counts mostly come down to differences in how the test data was set up in each version, which I think is an acceptable deviation.

So with that, all 7 Motor samples are done. For Home, I’m just waiting on Suraj to confirm which one we should pick up next.

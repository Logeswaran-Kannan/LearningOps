Hi Chris / Geanina,

I’m part of the Hazel team supporting the Radar Live delivery. I was contacted today by a member of the IAM service team regarding the retention of my system access. They informed me that approval from my line manager is still pending and asked me to follow up, as the deadline for this approval was 22nd July.

Could you please provide your approval at your earliest convenience? I’ve been advised that without timely approval, there is a risk of losing access.

Thank you for your support.

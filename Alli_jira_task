Hi Nate, good morning!

I’m doing some testing on the Athena front — specifically with flow2-bld2-evh002 — to make sure events are landing in ehubstream. As part of that, I pushed some test data Sunday evening, and it looked like it hit the event hub within a few minutes. Just want to confirm things on the bronze side now.

Do you know if our bronze ingestion reads from this event hub? And is that set up on both test and dev, or just dev?

Also, could you share the name of the workflow that handles this ingestion and when it last ran?

Appreciate the help!

🔄 Additional Data Ingestion Validation Areas
11. Ingestion Orchestration Validation
Validate the end-to-end pipeline execution from source (e.g., EventHub) through intermediate stages (Bronze) to Silverish layer.

Expected Outcome: All pipeline jobs are triggered in the right order with dependency awareness and status logged.

Why it's critical: Prevents race conditions and partial ingestion.

12. Event Trigger Validation (from EventHub)
Ensure that each incoming event from EventHub correctly triggers the ingestion workflow.

Expected Outcome: Every event results in a triggered ingestion job; no drops or missed triggers.

Why it’s critical: Real-time systems depend on reliable event capture.

13. Checkpointing & Replay Mechanism
Validate that checkpointing works as expected and supports replay for failed/missed messages.

Expected Outcome: Messages can be replayed from checkpoints without duplication or loss.

Why it’s critical: Ensures data resiliency and fault recovery.

14. Pipeline Failure & Retry Logic
Deliberately simulate failures in ingestion and validate whether retry logic or fallback paths function as designed.

Expected Outcome: Failures are retried (where configured); alerts are raised and logged.

Why it’s critical: Maintains reliability in production pipelines.

15. Latency & SLA Tracking
Measure time taken from event ingestion (EventHub) to data landing in Silverish layer; compare against defined SLA.

Expected Outcome: Ingestion completes within agreed SLA windows.

Why it’s critical: Supports real-time and near-real-time reporting use cases.

16. Partitioning & Distribution Strategy Validation
Validate that data is evenly and logically partitioned across distributed storage or processing nodes (e.g., by Quote ID, Date).

Expected Outcome: No skewed partitions; consistent distribution across workers.

Why it’s critical: Impacts performance and downstream joins.

17. Schema Evolution Handling
Test ingestion behavior when schema changes (e.g., new fields added or removed) and how backward compatibility is maintained.

Expected Outcome: System handles schema drift or flags unsupported changes.

Why it’s critical: Ensures pipeline robustness over time.

18. Audit & Lineage Logging
Ensure complete lineage logs are captured from EventHub through each layer (Bronze → Silverish) including timestamps and transformation details.

Expected Outcome: Each record has traceable audit trail and transformation lineage.

Why it’s critical: Supports compliance, debugging, and accountability.

19. Environment-Specific Config Validation
Validate that ingestion parameters, endpoints, and configs (e.g., connection strings, paths) are correct per environment (dev/test/prod).

Expected Outcome: No misrouted messages or config-based ingestion failures.

Why it’s critical: Prevents production data loss due to misconfiguration.

out of scope

Certainly! Here's a comprehensive "Out of Scope" section tailored to the Radar Live Data Ingestion testing phase, especially with your expanded pipeline context (EventHub → Bronze → Silverish → COS/EDW/EDM).

❌ Out of Scope – Data Ingestion Testing Phase
These areas are excluded from the current scope of data ingestion validation (Day 1), either because they are covered in downstream phases, handled by other teams, or fall under non-functional or operational testing categories.

🔹 1. Downstream Business Logic & Gold Layer Transformations
Detailed business rule validations (e.g., premium calculations, discount rules, etc.) applied in the Gold/COS/EDW layers are out of scope.

Covered under business rules or curated layer validation.

🔹 2. Front-End (UI/UX) Validation
Any display/UI validations (e.g., via portals, dashboards, reporting interfaces) are not part of this ingestion validation phase.

🔹 3. Data Visualization/Reporting Accuracy
BI layer or analyst views (e.g., Power BI, Tableau, or curated dashboards) data checks are excluded.

🔹 4. Load Testing & Performance Benchmarks
Throughput, concurrent ingestion rates, and stress/load testing fall under the non-functional testing phase and are out of scope here.

🔹 5. Data Archival & Retention Policy Testing
Validations for long-term storage, archival workflows, or deletion policies are not included in this round.

🔹 6. End-to-End Security Testing
Role-based access control, encryption in transit/rest, and data masking are managed by the platform and security team.

🔹 7. Manual Enrichment & External Vendor Testing
Any manual data enrichment from third parties (e.g., Sapiens) not tied to ingestion logic is excluded from testing.

🔹 8. Infrastructure or Failover Testing
Infrastructure failures, network simulation, or disaster recovery scenarios are handled under infrastructure-level NFR testing.

🔹 9. Change Data Capture (CDC) & Delta Loads
CDC logic and delta load validations are not part of this phase unless explicitly triggered via ingestion.

🔹 10. Data Governance & Compliance Audits
Compliance checks (GDPR, audit readiness) and data governance enforcement are not included in functional ingestion testing.

Consider these points as well

Thanks! Based on the latest image you provided—which outlines the Radar Live system components, their impacts, and associated data flows—here’s how we can refine and expand your data ingestion validation scope with precise, testable additions.

✅ Enhanced Radar Live – Data Ingestion Validation Scope (with Architecture Alignment)
This list integrates validation logic not only for message structure and mapping but also for platform orchestration, streaming, and storage behavior based on Azure components: MQS, Event Hub, Databricks, Delta Lake, and Raw Landing.

1. MQS Event Message Orchestration Validation
Scope: From MQS to Azure Event Hub
Test: Validate that MQS successfully publishes rating messages to the correct Azure Event Hub topic per product system.
Expected Outcome: Messages are correctly partitioned, published, and visible in Azure Event Hub without loss or delay.

2. Event Hub Message Delivery Validation
Scope: From Azure Event Hub → Azure Data Platform (Databricks)
Test: Validate that all messages published in Event Hub are consumed by Databricks as per expected frequency, batch/window logic.
Expected Outcome: No messages are dropped or processed out of order; offset and checkpointing work as designed.

3. Databricks Stream Consumption Validation
Scope: Streaming job from AEH to Delta Lake (Raw Landing)
Test: Validate that Databricks jobs successfully pick up messages from Event Hub and transform/store them into the Raw Landing tables.
Expected Outcome: Message count in Raw Landing = message count published to Event Hub (minus known filtered cases).

4. Raw Landing Table Validation in Delta Lake
Scope: Delta Lake ingestion (Raw Zone)
Test: Validate that Raw Landing zone contains all unmodified messages and adheres to table schema structure (Parquet format).
Expected Outcome: Full-fidelity raw message storage; metadata and ACID compliance maintained.

5. Delta Lake Table Transition Validation
Scope: Transition from Raw → Refined or Silver Layer
Test: Validate transformation logic and partitioning strategy used in Delta Lake layer is correctly applied for downstream consumption.
Expected Outcome: Fields transformed per ingestion mapping; timestamp- and key-based partitioning maintained.

6. Data Lineage & Traceability Validation
Scope: Across MQS → AEH → Databricks → Delta Lake
Test: Ensure that each record can be traced back to its original MQS source through metadata (e.g., message ID, timestamp).
Expected Outcome: Data lineage is intact and accessible in audit/log tables or metadata stores.

7. Failure Handling & Replay Readiness
Scope: Any point of failure in the pipeline
Test: Validate that system logs failures, checkpoints correctly, and can replay data from a certain offset.
Expected Outcome: Reprocessing can occur without duplication; failed batches are logged with diagnostic messages.

8. Multi-Tenant/Topic Isolation Validation
Scope: Across product systems using shared Event Hubs
Test: Validate that each MQS product system uses the correct topic/stream within the shared Event Hub.
Expected Outcome: No cross-contamination of messages across product systems; logical separation maintained.

❌ Still Out of Scope
UI-level validation of pricing/quotes

Reporting platform testing (Power BI, etc.)

Business rule logic in Gold/COS/EDW

Non-functional SLAs (performance, DR failover)

Manual intervention/reprocessing

Security model and RBAC enforcement

✅ Suggested Enhancements to Your QA Planning:
Add checkpoints after each D1 → D3 flow from the architecture table.

Include a lineage trace matrix mapping message ID from MQS → Raw Table.

Create mock EventHub inputs to simulate various test conditions (e.g., late arrivals, malformed messages).

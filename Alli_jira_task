Hi [Name],

Just wanted to keep you in the loop — last week, Phil and Hazel reached out to discuss the possibility of me stepping into a Test Lead role for the Radar Live project, in addition to my current involvement in the GW Upgrade project supporting Amirtha and Rahul.

There were some concerns raised regarding the testing front on Radar Live. While I believe it's still a bit early to make a full judgment, both sides have shared their perspectives. That said, the main ask is to bring in a similar test infrastructure to what we’ve implemented for GW Upgrade.

Given the current test execution underway, I’ve agreed to split my time — half-day on GW and half-day on Radar Live — and officially started supporting Radar Live from today. I’m comfortable managing both for now, especially since there’s a strong client focus and urgency to get things moving from a testing perspective.

Not sure if this has already been communicated through Hazel, Phil, or Amirtha — just wanted to keep you informed. Let me know if you'd like to discuss anything further on this.

Thanks!

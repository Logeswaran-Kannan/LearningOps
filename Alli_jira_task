Apologies, I should’ve provided a bit more context earlier. The SQL shared by Paul is just to help ensure we’re not missing any tables in the data load process — we had found a few missed tables previously, which were later added back in.

At the moment, I can see all the other tables under std001 except this one. Would it be possible for you to include this table in the std001 load process as well?

Thanks!

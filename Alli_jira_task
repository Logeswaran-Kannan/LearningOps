So if we're aiming to validate the latest 2 days’ worth of data, then the correct approach would be:

First load (pre-load): Clear and load data up to 2 days before the max UPDATE_TIME

Second load (post-load): Load data covering the 2-day window ending at the max UPDATE_TIME

This way, the delta check will reflect only the latest 2 days’ worth of additions/changes, which aligns with the intent of the comparison.

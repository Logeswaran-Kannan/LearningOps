Just wanted to give you an early heads-up — I’m planning to take leave from 26th August to 12th September as my dad has a surgery scheduled during that time back in my home country.

I’ve looked at the timelines, and I believe by then the Guidewire upgrade should have settled into production, and for Radar Live, the testing team would be entering the execution phase. I’ll ensure that everything from my side is in place for a smooth handover and readiness before I head off.

Also, just in case support is needed, I’m happy to connect remotely from India starting the week of 8th September, provided that’s allowed. I should be available to assist if required.

I don’t have any other leave planned before or after this, so just wanted to get this period approved early. Let me know if you’d like to discuss or plan around it.

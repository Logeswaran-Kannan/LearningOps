Invalid Date Format in accidenttime Column ‚Äì Value 0002-01-01 BC Causing Workflow Failure in MI Claim Flow

üìù Defect Summary:
As part of the data quality validation on the Read Replica (PostgreSQL) environment post-migration from Oracle, an issue was identified in the ccx_coa_cnf_message_ext table. The accidenttime column contains invalid or unexpected historical date values, such as 0002-01-01 BC.

This format is not compatible with downstream processing workflows, and as a result, has been observed to cause failures in the BICOE ‚Äì MI layer, particularly in the Claim flow ingestion.

Key points:

The source (Oracle) did not contain such values, indicating either a transformation issue or a data inconsistency introduced during migration.

The invalid date format breaks standard datetime parsers and violates expected input for downstream jobs.

This is a critical data quality issue with direct impact on automated claim processing workflows.

Immediate investigation is required to:

Confirm the origin of these values (source vs. transformation).

Apply remediation, either by filtering, null handling, or defaulting during ingestion.

Prevent recurrence in future loads.

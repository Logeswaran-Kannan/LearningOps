As we discussed in the defect triage, these columns are part of the downstream lineage — they’re present in Oracle but missing in the Read Replica. In addition to the 3 columns we already flagged as impacting downstream, we’ve now identified 8 more through Unity Catalog lineage, so that brings the total to 11 columns.

That said, Unity Catalog has some limitations — it doesn’t tell us if these columns are used specifically in filter conditions. So, I’m planning to work on a solution to parse each notebook and check if any of the missing columns are being used in filters within the scripts. Will keep you posted on that.

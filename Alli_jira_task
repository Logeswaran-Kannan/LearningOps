✅ SIT Scope – Rating Response (EDM) Validation – MI Perspective
🪙 Silver Layer – Data Vault
🔧 Functional Validation
Validate successful ingestion of MQS Rating Response messages into the Silver Layer tables.

Confirm presence and mapping of core fields:

Quote ID, PRN, Cache ID, Decline Codes, Rating Premium, Adjustments

Validate schema structure aligns with Data Vault modeling standards (hub/link/sat).

Ensure all versions of Rating Responses (if re-quotes or updates) are stored with versioning and timestamps.

Validate referential integrity across Quote Domain, PreComp, and Core Risk data sets.

Confirm accurate decoding of raw error codes and decline codes for categorization.

Ensure data completeness across records — no nulls for critical fields (e.g., Quote ID, Premium).

Confirm Stop Quote and Failed Quote records are recorded with appropriate status.

🚀 Non-functional Validation
Confirm batch ingestion process completes within defined SLA (e.g., hourly or daily window).

Validate error logs and audit trails for each batch job.

Test data masking rules for sensitive fields where applicable.

Validate CDC or delta load works (i.e., no overwrite of historical data unless intended).

Ensure Silver layer supports downstream propagation to Gold without breaking schema.

🥇 Gold Layer – EDM (Enterprise Data Model)
🔧 Functional Validation
Validate transformation of Silver-layer Rating Response data into structured Gold-layer dimensional models.

Confirm mapping of:

Rating Premium

Decline Reasons (pre/post rating)

Endorsements

Payment Eligibility

Risk Score Outputs

Validate business aggregations (e.g., quote outcome summaries, decline trends).

Confirm Rating Response metrics are available and aligned to user domains:

Pricing, Underwriting, MI analysts

Validate that grouped decline codes (e.g., R001 = High Risk Area) appear consistently in the Gold EDM outputs.

Validate Stop Quote and Error Messages are correctly presented with context.

Confirm user-level access (RBAC) is enabled for domain-specific usage (e.g., pricing vs. MI).

🚀 Non-functional Validation
Validate daily refresh of Gold Layer with latest Silver inputs (T-1 data by 9 AM).

Confirm that dashboards using Gold data respond within acceptable time limits (query performance).

Validate audit logging for changes to the Rating Response Gold tables.

Confirm data is ready and validated for UAT/MI reporting workflows.

❌ Out-of-Scope Items
Upstream Precomp scoring logic or pricing algorithm correctness.

UI rendering of quote response or stop quote messages.

Integration of Rating Response with claims or policy administration systems.

Real-time data loads or Kafka/EventHub flows (only batch data scope is included).

Downstream external report validation in Power BI/Looker unless explicitly linked to Gold Layer fields.

⚠️ Caveats
Business meaning and justification of decline codes must be validated by UAT teams, not MI QA.

The presence of Rating Response data does not confirm quote success — only its availability for reporting.

Versioning logic is expected to be handled within Silver; QA assumes this is implemented.

CDC/Delta processing is assumed to preserve history unless flagged otherwise.

👥 Business Scenario View (UAT-Aligned)
Scenario	Layer	Who Validates	What to Validate

Rating Response aligns with Quote ID & Cache ID	Silver & Gold	MI QA	Referential joins are correct
Daily refreshed Rating Response is available in reports	Gold	MI QA	T-1 quote responses are visible by 9 AM
Decline codes are grouped into reporting categories	Gold	UAT	Declines appear under correct business logic
U/W team can extract rating outcome & quote error	Gold	UAT + MI	Complete visibility for MI insights
Pre vs Post Decline analysis supported in reporting	Gold	UAT	Decline reasons separated and traceable

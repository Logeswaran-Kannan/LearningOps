Hi Paul,

Thanks for the detailed analysis on the lineage mapping — really helpful.

Based on my understanding, I believe the following actions would help bring this to closure. Please do correct me if I’ve interpreted anything differently.

Data-Level Actions:
From the list of missing columns and the lineage dependencies identified, it seems the next step would be to check with Guidewire. Could we consolidate and finalize this list to share with them? Once confirmed, we’d also need to identify the mapping details for those specific columns from their side.

Regarding the PROD ORA vs RR comparison, I noticed that two Claims tables (each with 2 records) are still missing in RR. I’m not sure if these have any downstream dependencies — all other missing tables are fine as they’re not present in PROD. I’m happy to close this item once we clarify whether these two tables should be included or are safe to exclude from the RR.

For the legacy tactical NDM dependency, we’ll need confirmation from Brando regarding the ‘Paid’ column.

Process-Level Notes:
I think it would be good to include us as approvers in the process, especially if there are any future additions or removals of columns in finalized tables. Even though schema drift handling is available, any such changes ideally should go through the right review channel to assess their downstream impact.

For columns that have consistently held null or zero values in PROD — and are currently not present in the RR — I believe, based on the lineage mapping, we can treat those as approved for exclusion from RR. Just wondering if this needs to be captured somewhere in Confluence or another location for future reference, especially for traceability during testing signoff?

Let me know your thoughts on the above, or if anything needs tweaking.

Thanks again!

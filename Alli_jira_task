Title:
Radar Live â€“ Technical Ingestion Scenario Validation Against DQ Standards

Description:
As part of the Radar Live project, we need to validate the technical ingestion scenarios to ensure they meet established Data Quality (DQ) standards. The goal is to systematically test and confirm that data ingested through the pipeline adheres to business rules, data integrity checks, and conforms to format and accuracy standards.

This ticket covers:

Reviewing existing ingestion logic and workflow

Identifying key data quality checks (e.g., null validation, data type conformity, timestamp format)

Mapping test scenarios to each applicable DQ rule

Documenting gaps or deviations

Providing test evidence for successful ingestion

Acceptance Criteria / Definition of Done (DoD):
 All technical ingestion touchpoints identified and documented

 DQ standards mapped to relevant ingestion points

 At least one test scenario created and executed per DQ rule

 All failed cases documented and flagged

 Summary report with scenario outcomes attached to the ticket

 Walkthrough/demo completed with testing/engineering team

Right now, these are the ones I believe are able to log in and have their folders created. But from what I heard when we discussed on Friday, Simon’s folder is created, but he’s still not able to connect to the jump server.

On the bright side, I noticed the C drive space has been increased, which seems to have fixed the frequent disconnect issues for the ones who are already able to connect.

🐞 Defect Title:
Boolean Value Reversion in ODS Layer After Incremental Load – 1/0 Reset to true/false

📝 Defect Summary:
As part of the post-migration validation between the Oracle source and the Read Replica (PostgreSQL), an issue was observed with boolean column values in the ODS layer.

A fix was applied previously to standardize boolean fields as 1 and 0 (to match Oracle representation), replacing the PostgreSQL default of true and false. However, after the most recent incremental load this morning, the boolean values in the ODS tables have reverted back to their original true/false format.

This suggests that the previous fix may not have been retained in the ingestion or transformation logic, or it may not have been applied consistently across load jobs. As a result, the current state of data no longer aligns with the expected format used for testing and downstream processing.

This reversion may impact:

Automated validation scripts, which expect numeric values for consistency

Downstream data transformations or integrations that rely on a specific format

Data comparison with Oracle source, leading to mismatches

Further investigation is needed to confirm where the transformation is being overwritten and ensure the fix is made persistent across future loads.

Thanks, Graham — appreciate you taking the time to review the profile and for the support on mentorship, that’s really helpful.

I’ll follow up with Nat to initiate the onboarding process from the Cognizant side and will also gather the necessary details for Jeevitha’s Allianz onboarding, so Hazel can raise the request accordingly.

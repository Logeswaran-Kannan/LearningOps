Thanks, Simon and Paul. I understand the column was always NULL on-prem, but since it’s referenced downstream, I think we should either retain it in the structure with NULLs in the ods_views or make sure all dependencies are cleaned up.

Just trying to confirm from a production deployment perspective — this column should still be present in the ods_views DDL, right? Otherwise, if any downstream scripts (views, notebooks, dashboards, etc.) reference it, wouldn’t that lead to runtime errors?

Asking because I noticed the column isn’t there in the ods_views in the test environment.

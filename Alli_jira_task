Hi all,

I’ve shared the list of ingestion technical test scenarios in the Confluence page linked below. These will form part of our Day 1 test execution scope for the streaming source.

The scenarios are also mapped to our data quality standards, and I’ll be linking them to the project requirements shortly. Just to clarify — this focuses purely on technical validation related to data and engineering workflows. Business data validations will be handled separately.

Please have a look and share any feedback you may have. I’ll set up a walkthrough session around mid-month, once everyone is back from leave.

Thanks in advance for your input!

DDL validation is done — we’ve checked for missing columns, additional columns, extra tables, and datatype mismatches. Next step is to clean up the automation pack by removing unnecessary columns and tables. One missing column has downstream impact, and we’ve already flagged it to the business team for post-Day 1 handling.

For RAW to ODS, about 70% of scoped tables (that’s 692 across PC, BC, CC) have passed validation. The rest are still under review, mostly due to claim workflow failures and frequent updates on the source DB. Plan is to close that off today.

ODS to Staging validation has completed one round — we’re now running this under orchestration to widen coverage.

ODS to ODS_VIEW: also one round completed, and it’s now being run under orchestration to check for any CDC issues.

Silver layer test design is in progress using our automated query extraction. But for execution, there’s a dependency — 151 tables still need to be loaded. Devs are working on switching schemas manually in the test env, something that’ll be handled via ADF in prod. This might delay the timeline a bit, so we’ve raised it as a risk and may look to reduce scope based on priority.

Manual test data entry for PC is done for both legacy and automation flows — scenario validation is ongoing. BC and CC test data key-in is next.

Defect-wise, we’ve made good progress — most open ones are now closed, and triage discussions are going well.

inal Test Scope – Core Risk Data (Radar Live)
🔹 A. Bronze Layer – MQS Quote Request
Validate that Core Risk is embedded in MQS Quote Request payload as a nested structure.

Confirm that the full message (including Core Risk JSON) is landed into Bronze with correct schema.

Validate schema completeness and adherence to ingestion mapping.

Ensure no loss of nested Core Risk metadata or structure.

Confirm decompression and storage for embedded raw Core Risk.

🔹 B. Silver Layer – Data Vault – Core Risk
Parse Core Risk into structured tables (Hub, Satellite, Link models).

Validate support for multiple insured objects per quote.

Validate quote-level referential integrity using MQS-provided Unique Quote ID.

Verify correct linking of Interaction ID and related business keys.

Ensure timestamp/versioning strategy supports CDC and auditability.

Confirm metadata lineage for each field (from source → Data Vault).

Verify enrichment logic (e.g., from PreComp or DVLA flag values) is retained in this layer.

🔹 C. Gold Layer – EDM – Core Risk
Validate the dimensional model representation of Core Risk.

Confirm that EDM Core Risk objects aggregate correctly per quote.

Validate quote linking via Cache ID (used internally only).

Verify flags for orphaned Core Risk records are set appropriately.

Confirm quote declines are traceable (e.g., via null-premium transactions).

Ensure PII masking is enforced in sensitive columns (e.g., customer details).

Validate DVLA compliance by confirming only self-declared values exist.

Ensure semantic correctness of calculated risk metrics, segmentations, or categorization.

🔹 D. Additional Functional Coverage from Data Modeling Notes
Quote Linking: Validate Cache ID logic enables chain-of-quotes navigation (e.g., original, re-quote, MTA).

Orphaned Risk: Ensure unmatched quotes still populate risk records flagged with null premiums.

Quote Declines: Test rule-based decline indicators (e.g., validation failure categories).

Insured Object Granularity: Confirm support for multi-vehicle quotes per record.

Referential Integrity: Check that all related risk entities resolve correctly in both Silver and Gold.

PII Data: Confirm masking policy enforcement and RBAC (no exposure in lower-permission roles).

DVLA Data: Confirm DVLA source only reflects permitted content and not external system dependencies.

📊 General Data Warehouse Validation Coverage (Silver & Gold)
Applicable to Data Vault (Silver) and EDM (Gold) layers:

Structural validation: Column presence, data types, and constraints.

Business key validation: Keys like Quote ID, Cache ID, Customer ID must be accurate and non-null.

Referential integrity: FK relationships across fact/dimension tables.

Audit fields: Created_Timestamp, Modified_By, and CDC indicators should be populated.

Version control: Satellite tables should reflect latest versions and soft deletes where applicable.

Masking/obfuscation checks for PII and sensitive columns.

Timeliness: Data arrival time in Silver and Gold aligns with processing SLAs.

❌ Out of Scope – Core Risk Validation
Real-time streaming or SLA performance testing.

UI or dashboard (Power BI, Looker) rendering/analytics of Core Risk.

Business rule definition/ownership (e.g., how Underwriting rules are formed).

Manual assessment of rating decline logic accuracy.

Downstream system integrations consuming EDM data.

Data export jobs, archiving, or retention policy validations.

⚠️ Caveat
All validations mentioned here apply only to the Radar Live Core Risk flow as defined across Bronze, Silver (Data Vault), and Gold (EDM).
Any functionality or data handling not explicitly listed as “in scope” above is to be considered out of scope, including inferred analytics, downstream consumption, or cross-system reconciliation.
Validation of real-time insights, performance, or security controls is managed under separate NFR and UAT tracks.

Absolutely — here’s the enhanced and complete final scope for Core Risk data validation, now also incorporating Business UAT coverage from a quote journey perspective. This includes validations for real-world business workflows where Core Risk influences or supports key decisions across quoting, rating, and post-decision analysis.

✅ Final Core Risk Test Scope – Radar Live
🧱 Layers: Bronze → Silver (Data Vault) → Gold (EDM)
🧭 Scope Perspective: QA + Business UAT
🔹 A. Bronze Layer – MQS Quote Request
Ensure Core Risk object is fully received in MQS quote message.

Validate JSON schema and field presence (including nested metadata).

Confirm integrity of Cache ID and Unique Quote ID for quote traceability.

Decompression and landing of Core Risk data in raw format (ODS zone).

Initial referential linkage between Rating Request and Core Risk included.

🔹 B. Silver Layer – Data Vault – Core Risk
Core Risk structured into entities (hub/satellite/link tables).

Business keys (e.g., Quote ID, Interaction ID) maintain uniqueness.

Enrichments and flags (PreComp, DVLA) are preserved.

Support for multi-vehicle quoting (granularity check).

CDC markers and versioning applied to support lifecycle traceability.

Integrity checks for linking with Quote Request and PreComp data.

🔹 C. Gold Layer – EDM – Core Risk
Core Risk dimensions support reporting at the quote level.

Cache ID enables chained quote journeys (original → re-quote → MTA).

Risk records appear in analytics even for orphaned quotes (no pricing outcome).

Quote Decline indicators are present (Standard Validation Rules, null-premium).

PII is masked per GDPR in reports.

Referential alignment with Quote Domain ensures drill-through.

👥 Business UAT – Quote Journey Coverage
From an end-user/business validation perspective, key quote lifecycle flows include:

✅ 1. Quote Journey Reconstruction (Cache ID Traceability)
Confirm user can trace entire quote chain via Cache ID.

Example: Original Quote → Re-Quote → MTA → Final Accept

✅ 2. Quote Decline Analysis
Validate visibility of declined quotes within EDM even if they failed rating.

Confirm reasons tied to Core Risk (e.g., failed underwriting rules) are traceable.

Underwriters can identify and segment declines by business rule violations.

✅ 3. Orphaned Risk Record Handling
Ensure quotes that were never rated (or were stopped early) still generate Core Risk records.

“Null-premium” flag identifies these cleanly for reporting.

✅ 4. Multi-Vehicle Quotes (Granularity Handling)
Core Risk accommodates multiple insured items under the same Quote ID.

Business users can report risk per object (vehicle, driver) in a multi-line quote.

✅ 5. Reporting Alignment
Core Risk dimensions correctly feed into EDM dashboards for:

Decline metrics

Underwriting risk segmentation

Quote success rates by risk segment

✅ 6. Audit & Traceability for UAT Logs
Business UAT testers can track where risk data comes from (Cache ID → Interaction ID → Risk Record).

Ability to tie decisions (e.g., decline, quote change) back to source risk values.

❌ Out of Scope – Core Risk (QA + UAT)
UI-level form validation (e.g., quoting portal display of risk)

Real-time scoring engine behavior

Business rule engine logic validation itself (UAT focuses on output, not rule engine internals)

Rating/Pricing accuracy (assumed tested in pricing engine validation)

Any analytics/reporting outputs outside of Core Risk EDM view

Exporting/reporting tools (Power BI, Qlik) not part of this scope

⚠️ Caveat
Only the quote journey use cases and validations explicitly listed above are in-scope for Business UAT.
Any unlisted journey combinations, UI-based behaviors, or decisioning rule accuracy must be validated under their respective streams (e.g., Rating, UI UAT, Decisioning).
Only EDM data sourced via the Core Risk pipeline is covered. Use in other domains (e.g., Claims) is not part of this release.

Would you like this entire scope delivered in a business-friendly UAT Test Charter, traceability matrix, or linked to a Jira UAT Epic for formal sign-off?

We'll go over the details on the call, but just to clarify—there aren’t any direct dependencies on Jamie apart from the E2E testing side of things. Jamie had already started testing this part before our phase kicked off this sprint. He’s been working with the schema and data files placed in the shared folder, and we’ve used those (along with the mapping document) mainly as a reference to spot mismatches.

That said, Rahul has prepared our own set of test files specifically for this testing. So, in short—our execution starts this week, and we’ve already come across some observations. We're just leveraging Jamie’s prior experience to help address them more efficiently.

Our test window officially runs from the 21st to the 29th, and during that time, we’ll only be coordinating with Jamie from an E2E perspective.

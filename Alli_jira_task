Apologies for the delay. I've prepared the high-level test scope for Day 1 SIT based on our last discussion and have documented it in Confluence. Please feel free to review and share with the team.

This is a high-level view, as some of the HLDs are still pending. The scope is based on the available mappings and what we've agreed so far.

Let me know if you have any questions or need clarifications.

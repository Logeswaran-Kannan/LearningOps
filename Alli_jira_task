MI â€“ ODS Layer: Duplicate Records Detected in 19 PC Tables Compared to Read Replica

ðŸ“‹ Defect Summary:
As part of the data validation exercise between the ODS layer and the Read Replica source for Policy Center (PC) tables, a duplicate record check was performed on a total of 261 tables.

Out of these, 19 tables were identified with duplicate records loaded into the ODS layer, which do not exist in the same form in the Read Replica source.

This indicates a potential issue in the data ingestion or transformation logic leading to unintended duplication at the ODS level. The impacted tables and sample duplicate counts are captured for reference and further investigation.

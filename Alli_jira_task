Yeah, I’ll go ahead and raise this as a defect. I’ll also check in with the application team to take a closer look at it. Thanks, Paul.

I believe you’ll be resuming the load for CC now — in the meantime, I’ll review PC and BC. I’ll also do a quick check on the RR side for the tables we’re not loading, just to make sure there aren’t any similar discrepancies.

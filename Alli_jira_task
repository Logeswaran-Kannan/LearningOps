Hey everyone,

Just to get us all on the same page — for validating the Silver and outbound transmit files through the automation framework, we were initially looking at using STD001. But for consistency in the three-way reconciliation and downstream layer validation, Paul, I believe you were suggesting that core_tst might be the better schema to work with — just want to confirm that’s still the recommendation?

From a testing perspective — Graham — the aim for both manual and automated validation is to ensure that the cloud version of the data doesn’t introduce any issues in the Silver or downstream layers, whether it’s in terms of data mismatches or count differences. So ideally, the same test data from STD001 should be flowing through into Silver and then downstream, right?

To achieve that, Paul — is the plan to create the cloud version of the tables inside core_tst, and then repoint the Silver schema logic to read from those? Just want to make sure I’ve understood this correctly.

As an example:
If we take the veh_coverage_premium_trans table — in the ODS view, I see two versions — one coming from the legacy sys9, and another based on the cloud data in STD001.
So the question is:

Are we loading data into the same Silver table and switching the source between legacy (sys9) and cloud (STD001) during testing?
Or

Will there be two separate versions of the Silver table — one pointing to the legacy data and the other to the cloud version — to compare side-by-side?

Would be great to align on the approach so we can plan the automation accordingly.

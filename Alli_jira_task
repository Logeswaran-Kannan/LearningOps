Weekly Testing Update – Summary

Structure Validation
Validation of schema structure—covering missing columns, additional columns, extra tables, and data type differences—has been completed. Based on the findings, unnecessary tables and columns with no downstream dependencies have been excluded from the automation pack as part of risk acceptance. For the missing column that is used downstream, the impact has been assessed and business users have been notified of a post-Day 1 update.

RAW to ODS Validation (Partial Automation – Test Environment)
As part of a shift-left testing approach, we completed the first execution cycle covering nearly 90% of the 692 active tables across PC, BC, and CC. Failed cases are currently under review, and defect fixes are in progress. This additional layer of testing improves early detection and overall data quality assurance.

ODS Staging to ODS Validation
One full round of automated validation has been completed. We're now integrating this into orchestration to ensure broader coverage during daily test loads.

ODS to ODS_VIEW Validation
A full automated execution run was also completed here. We’re continuing to monitor under orchestration to catch any issues related to change data capture logic.

Silver Layer Testing
Test design is underway using automated query extraction. However, test execution is currently blocked due to delays in data load for 151 identified tables. The delays are tied to dependent table creation and required configuration updates. This has been flagged as a risk, and we’re working to mitigate it by prioritizing tables and potentially trimming scope to stay aligned with revised timelines.

Manual Test Execution
Test data entry for PC (both legacy and automation paths) has been completed. Script validation is ongoing. For BC and CC, test data entry is scheduled to start next week.

🐞 Defect 1: MI - Read Replica: Missing Tables Compared to Oracle
Description:
During DDL comparison between Oracle and Read Replica (PostgreSQL), 272 tables were found to be missing in the Read Replica environment, despite being present in the Oracle test environment.
Upon further triage, it was identified that only 2 of these tables exist in the Claims production environment; the remaining tables are non-prod or unused. However, as there was no prior requirement or confirmation to exclude these tables, the absence of these two production tables requires clarification or remediation.

🐞 Defect 2: MI - Read Replica: Additional Tables Without Requirement
Description:
A total of 737 additional tables were found in the Read Replica that do not exist in the Oracle environment.
Out of these, only 356 tables contain any data, while the remaining 381 have zero records. These appear to be part of the cloud upgrade, potentially for future use or lacking test data at this stage.
As these new tables were not included in the original requirements, they are being tracked here as a low-priority defect for visibility.

🐞 Defect 3: MI - Read Replica: Additional Columns Not in Oracle
Description:
There are 2216 new columns present in the Read Replica that are not found in Oracle, all within existing tables. These columns seem to have been introduced as part of the cloud upgrade effort.
However, since this addition wasn’t covered under the original migration requirements, a new process is recommended to govern the addition or removal of columns in source systems to ensure downstream lineage is validated before deployment.

🐞 Defect 4: MI - Read Replica: Data Precision Mismatch
Description:
A precision-level mismatch was identified in one table between Oracle and Read Replica. While this does not currently appear to impact data accuracy, the inconsistency is being tracked as a low-severity defect for future visibility and documentation.

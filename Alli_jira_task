Hope you're doing well. I wanted to check if you could help with evaluating a testing profile we've received from the Cognizant side for the BICOE team. We're in the process of onboarding someone to support our Radar Live testing activities, and your input would be really valuable in assessing the fit from a testing perspective.

If you have some time today or later this week, Iâ€™d be happy to arrange a quick discussion with the candidate. Based on your feedback, we can decide whether to move forward or continue looking for a better-suited profile.

Hi Chris / Geanina,

I was contacted by a member of the IAM service team today regarding the retention of my system access. They mentioned that line manager approval is still pending and advised me to follow up, as the deadline was 22/07.

Could you please provide your approval at your earliest convenience? Iâ€™ve been informed that without it, I may risk losing access.

Thank you for your support.

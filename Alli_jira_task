Hi team,

I’ve set up a Manual Test Execution Progress Dashboard along with an Overall Defect Status Dashboard, which includes both manual and automation-related defects.

The defects are being raised under the GCU project, but the dashboard is filtered to track only our relevant tickets.

Going forward, we can use this dashboard to monitor overall progress. Feel free to take a look and let me know if you have any suggestions or if there’s anything you’d like to tweak.

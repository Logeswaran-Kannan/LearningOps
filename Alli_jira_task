My flight is on the evening of 22nd August, and since 25th is a bank holiday, I believe most people might have planned around that.

That said, I’m absolutely fine to support from India on the 23rd if the release goes ahead then — or even later in September. I’ll be available and flexible to help with the release and any post-release issues, just that I’d be supporting remotely from India during that period.

No problem at all from my side doing that — happy to help however needed.

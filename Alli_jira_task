 I’m scheduled to be away from 26th August to 12th September. I heard the release might be planned around the week of 5th September. If that’s the case, I’ll be in India at the time, but I’m more than happy to support remotely if working from India is okay.

If that works, I can cancel my leave for those specific days and stay available to help during the release window. Let me know what you think!

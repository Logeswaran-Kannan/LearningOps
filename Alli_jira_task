Data Format Mismatch ‚Äì Amount Fields Showing as 0E-18 in Read Replica Instead of 0.0 from Oracle

üìù Defect Summary:
During post-migration validation between the Oracle source and the Read Replica (PostgreSQL) target, a data format discrepancy was identified in several amount-related columns within the ODS tables.

In the Oracle source, these fields hold values like 0.0 (standard decimal notation). However, in the Read Replica (PostgreSQL), the same fields are represented as 0E-18, which is an exponential notation for zero.

While mathematically equivalent, this representation may lead to:

Unexpected behavior in downstream reporting or calculations

Formatting issues in data exports or UI displays

False mismatches during automated data comparison or regression scripts

This defect needs investigation to determine if the conversion is happening during ingestion or due to underlying datatype differences (e.g., NUMBER in Oracle vs. NUMERIC/DECIMAL in PostgreSQL). The impact and resolution path (e.g., formatting during ingestion or in downstream logic) should be evaluated.

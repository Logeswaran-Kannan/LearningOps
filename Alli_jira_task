Thanks for sharing this. I believe this is the schema you were referring to that's accessible from the test workspace for viewing production data.

Just to confirm â€” is this pointing to the actual production data that's synced daily, or is it a copy of the production data? Also, is there a specific Databricks URL or workspace we should use to view the production data directly?

Appreciate the clarification!

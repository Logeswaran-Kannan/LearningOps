Just sharing a quick weekly wrap-up on where we’re at with testing – and big shoutout to the whole team for the solid progress this week!

We’ve got about 60% of the High-Level Test Strategy doc done so far. The plan is to lock that down by mid next week and go through it together for feedback and alignment.

The Test Plan doc has already been reviewed and is being updated by Amirtha to reflect the confirmed Day 1 scope, based on inputs gathered across the team.

On the test scripting side, using the sample messages shared by Mule for both quote request and PRECOM request, we’ve built scripts to validate incoming messages against the silver-ish layer. The scope for Bronze and Silver-ish layers is now frozen, and we’re working closely with Mike to finalize the scope for Silver and Gold layers, including any new or changed tables.

Had a good catch-up with Nate to walk through the current test environment setup and the orchestration process. Based on that, the technical test scenarios for ingestion and silver-ish validation are now finalized and currently going through review. Once that’s done, we’ll share it with everyone to get agreement and buy-in.

For the vehicle feed validation (file vs Cosmos DB), the test scenario is also finalized, and we’ll be reviewing that with the team next week as well.

To get better clarity on test data and data flow understanding, we’re planning to set up time with Asuthosh from the Mule team—should help us fill in any blanks.

Test artifacts delivered this week:

✅ Technical ingestion validation scenarios (for both streaming and file-based sources) – now under peer review.

✅ Sample test script for one message – smoke test successfully run.

✅ File-based validation scripts for vehicle feed – completed.

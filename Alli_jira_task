Subject: Follow-up on Silver Load Test Assumptions Discussion â€“ Next Steps

Hi Team,

Thanks again for your time yesterday and for the valuable inputs during our discussion around the test assumptions for the silver load process â€” specifically on out-of-sequence messages, late arrivals, handling of missing messages, and reconciling message counts with the source.

Hereâ€™s a quick recap and next steps:

Source Message Handling:
Thereâ€™s currently no setup on the source application side to store or cache incoming messages. While metrics are expected to be logged, this raises a risk in case the source is unable to reprocess or resend missed messages when reconciliation issues are identified later in the process. Weâ€™ll need clearer test data to fully understand out-of-sequence or late-arrival scenarios more reliably.

Documenting Test Assumptions:
Nate and Glen will start capturing test-related assumptions for the ingestion process directly in the Confluence page. This will help ensure that everyone is aligned on what can be tested and whatâ€™s expected during execution.
ðŸ‘‰ Please find the [Confluence link here] â€” it would be great if you could add comments or notes against any of the action scenarios listed.

Pending Areas:
We still need to have a detailed discussion on non-functional aspects of ingestion such as schema drifting, backfill handling, and how business expects to use these reports in light of reconciliation gaps.


Pending Items â€“ Non-Functional Requirements:
There are still a few topics we need to discuss further, including schema drift, backfill handling, and business reporting expectations â€” weâ€™ll plan to cover those in upcoming sessions.

Let me know if I missed anything or if you have anything to add.

so the Friday 1 AM run (which actually picks up Thursday's application data from Guidewire) would be the last run from the BICOE side, right? Then the source switch happens on Friday. So, does Friday’s application data get picked up in the Saturday 1 AM run? Or do we only load that on Sunday at 1 AM?

Sorry, just trying to understand — in production, do the jobs usually run at 1 AM to capture the previous day’s data?

Subject: PC Scope Summary and Next Steps

Hi Graham,

Thanks for sharing the overall scope list. For Policy Center (PC), Iâ€™ve reviewed the schemas provided and included the managed tables and their corresponding views from the relevant schemas. The tables and views from other schemas have been kept out of scope for now, but we can always bring them in later if needed.

For the identified PC views and managed tables, Iâ€™ve compiled a list that includes:

Managed table names

Corresponding views that populate them

Row counts for comparison

View scripts

Breakdown of dependencies, including ODS, ODS_VIEW, and Silver tables used within the scripts

ðŸ”œ Next Action Items:
Iâ€™ve added a priority column to the list â€” could you please update it with values like 1, 2, 3 (with 1 being high priority)?

A few scripts failed the count comparison between the managed table and the corresponding view. For now, Iâ€™ve adjusted the count by temporarily removing anti-joins from the scripts, but weâ€™ll need some clarity on those joins to properly reconcile the data.

From the three-way reconciliation list, Iâ€™ve cross-checked and ensured that all applicable tables are included in the current scope. Thereâ€™s just one table thatâ€™s missing due to schema restrictions â€” let me know if we should bring that back into scope.

Let me know if you need anything else or want to review this together.

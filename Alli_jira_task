Hi Graham, just checking if you might have a slot today for a quick discussion with the candidate—happy to set something up today or Monday based on your availability. I can put a placeholder in the calendar accordingly. The candidate is also in process with a few other clients, so hoping to align this discussion soon before they proceed further. Let me know what works for you. Thanks again!

Schema Structure Validation
Validate that each ingested message strictly adheres to the schema defined in the ingestion mapping document.
Expected Outcome: All fields conform to the expected structure with no schema mismatch or ingestion failure.

Mandatory Field Validation
Ensure that all mandatory fields in the message are present and populated based on the ingestion mapping rules.
Expected Outcome: Ingestion fails gracefully if mandatory fields are missing and logs are properly captured.

Data Type & Format Validation
Validate that each field matches the defined data type (e.g., string, integer, date) and adheres to the format expected by the mapping specification.
Expected Outcome: Fields are successfully parsed; no data type or format-related ingestion errors occur.

Field-Level Mapping Accuracy
Verify that all source fields are correctly mapped to the target fields, including renamed or transformed fields.
Expected Outcome: Target tables reflect the expected field mappings, values, and data transformations.

Null & Default Value Handling
Validate how the ingestion handles missing optional fields or null values, including application of default values where required.
Expected Outcome: Ingestion completes with correct defaults where applicable, and invalid nulls are flagged or rejected.

Boundary & Limit Validation
Test ingestion behavior for edge cases such as maximum character lengths, numeric boundaries, and special characters.
Expected Outcome: No truncation, overflows, or data corruption; messages with out-of-bound values are handled per rules.

Duplicate Record Handling
Validate the systemâ€™s ability to detect and handle duplicate messages based on unique identifiers like Cache ID or Quote ID.
Expected Outcome: Duplicate messages are rejected or flagged, and no duplicate data is inserted into the target tables.

Reference Data Lookup Validation
Ensure that enrichment fields using reference data (e.g., DVLA, rating models) are correctly populated or handled if not found.
Expected Outcome: Valid lookups enrich the data correctly; missing references are logged and do not break ingestion.

Error Logging & Rejection Handling
Validate that incorrect or malformed messages are rejected with detailed logging that identifies the failure reason.
Expected Outcome: Failed messages are not processed and are logged with a clear reason and traceability.

Successful Load Confirmation
Confirm that valid messages are successfully ingested and appear in the Bronze layer with correct lineage and data completeness.
Expected Outcome: 100% of valid messages are recorded in Bronze with correct record counts and structure.

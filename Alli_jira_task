Subject: Candidate Profile & JD for Testing Role – Request to Schedule Discussion

Hi Graham,

Thanks again for agreeing to support with the evaluation process for the testing profile. Really appreciate you taking the time to look into this.

As discussed, I’ve attached the candidate’s profile along with the job description for your reference. Once you’ve had a chance to review, please let me know a suitable time for a quick discussion with the candidate. I’ll coordinate the rest from this side accordingly.

I’ve also looped in Nat here just to keep visibility on the overall hiring process.

Thanks again,

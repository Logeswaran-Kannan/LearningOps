Hey team, here's my quick update for today:

As part of this week's planning activity, we've finalized the technical test scenarios for the bronze layer. These scenarios cover everything from functional data validation to orchestration and fail-safe mechanisms — so we're confident it's a comprehensive set.

Based on the mapping document we have so far for the quote request message, we've identified:

21 bronze tables

8 silver tables

4 gold layer tables

For the other message types — precom request/response, stop quote, cache request/response — we’re still waiting for the finalized list of tables.

In terms of progress:

We've completed test scripting for one bronze table so far.

Planning to have a demo and test scenario walkthrough with the dev team early next week.

On the business test data side, we've started drafting scenarios covering the basics — New Business (NB), NB Quote, Prequote, Requote, Stop Quote, MTA Quote, and Renewal Quote.

We do need some additional info from the Athena side. I’ll sync up with Asuthosh to get more clarity on that.

Also, had a detailed conversation with Robert about vehicle info in Cosmos DB — we’ve kicked off test scripting today to validate file vs DB comparison. We’ll do a system test scenario walkthrough with Robert mid-next week to get his inputs.

Finally, what we’re looking to finalize:

Day 1 table list for estimating test timelines

Test environment readiness (especially for streaming and Cosmos DB sources)

Scope of testing for the presentation layer

And the volume of test data we’re planning to load.

That’s it from me — happy to dive deeper on any of these if needed.

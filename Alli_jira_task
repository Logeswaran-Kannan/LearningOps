Just a quick update — last week, Phil and Hazel spoke to me about possibly stepping into the Test Lead role for the Radar Live project, in addition to my current responsibilities on the GW Upgrade project supporting Amirtha and Rahul.

Their expectation is to bring in a similar test infrastructure setup to what we’ve implemented for GW Upgrade. I’ve agreed to support both projects for now, with a half-day focus on each, given the ongoing test execution on the GW side.

While there are some concerns that have been raised around Radar Live — including documentation gaps flagged by Amirtha — I feel it’s a bit early to dive too deep into those just yet. Phil and Hazel are mainly keen to ensure there’s strong test ownership on Radar Live due to its complexity.

I’ve started playing the role from today and I’m comfortable managing both for the time being. Not sure if this has already been communicated through Hazel, Phil, or Amirtha — just wanted to keep you in the loop.

Let me know if you’d like to chat further or if there’s anything that needs to be discussed.

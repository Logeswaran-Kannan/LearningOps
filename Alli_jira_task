Subject: Team Sync: Client Concerns & Alignment on Way of Working

Body:

Hi Team,

I’ve scheduled a short session to align on a few points following some recent client concerns that have been raised. The agenda will cover:

Summary of concerns/escalation points from the client

Discussion on current challenges or blockers from our side

Expectations going forward and suggested improvements in our way of working

Roles, responsibilities, and ownership clarity across the test lifecycle

Open floor for any feedback, suggestions, or risks we should flag proactively

This is more of an open and collaborative session to ensure we’re all on the same page and taking the right steps forward as a team.

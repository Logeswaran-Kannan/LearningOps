Got it, that’s helpful — thanks! I’ll dig in a bit more to see exactly where the data is landing.

Quick question on the filter you mentioned: is that applied after the data lands in ehubstream, or does it happen while reading from the event hub itself?

Just trying to figure out if the data actually reaches the event hub but then gets filtered out because it’s not in the expected RAML format.

We've observed a data formatting issue in certain claim-related tables where some symbols (e.g., diamond with a question mark �) appear in the data values. This seems to be a read or encoding issue, possibly due to how the data is stored in Guidewire or how it’s being interpreted when read into the PostgreSQL Read Replica.

Since the BICOE team is consuming the data as-is from the replica, we believe this may require investigation and resolution either at the Guidewire source or at the replica extraction layer.

Let us know your thoughts or if further details are needed from our end to support this analysis.

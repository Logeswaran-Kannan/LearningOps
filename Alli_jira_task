Hey all, I’ve completed the ingestion technical test scenarios for the streaming source using MQS messages. In yesterday’s meeting with Nate and Nita, I walked through how these scenarios also align with the data quality standards. Most of the DQ requirements are already covered, though there are a few operational-type scenarios where we might need Glen’s input.

I’ll be sharing the full list of technical scenarios with the team that we’ll be using for test execution and will do a walkthrough next week. I’ll share the Confluence page before that so everyone has a chance to review.

We’ve also mapped the DQ-related build and testing work in Jira to maintain requirement traceability. Apart from that, I’m currently working on the test strategy and might need a quick sync with Adrian soon.

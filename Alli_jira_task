| **ID / Name**              | **Scenario Description**                  | **How Itâ€™s Simulated**                       | **Expected Outcome**                             | **Checkpoint with Development Team**                                                                       |

| `Source System Issues_001` | Source data is **unavailable**            | Simulate total unavailability before RR load | Fails gracefully; alert raised                   | Confirm if this scenario can be simulated in test. Has this occurred before? What was the observed impact? |
| `Source System Issues_002` | Source data is **partially available**    | Simulate partial unavailability              | Fails gracefully; alert raised                   | Can partial loads be mimicked in the test environment? Has the team encountered this in production?        |
| `Connectivity_001`         | **Network is down**                       | Simulate network downtime before load        | Fails gracefully; alert raised                   | Can network disconnects be artificially triggered in lower environments?                                   |
| `Connectivity_002`         | **Invalid credentials**                   | Use invalid auth for RR load                 | Fails gracefully; alert raised                   | Ask dev team if they have observed auth/token errors. What recovery mechanism was triggered?               |
| `Schema_Mismatches_001`    | **New columns added** in source           | Add a column before load                     | New columns are ignored                          | Can source schema be altered in test? Did similar changes happen in prod before?                           |
| `Schema_Mismatches_002`    | **Expected columns are missing**          | Remove a column then load                    | Load fails; reset needed; columns loaded as NULL | Can this test be run in UAT without corrupting schema? What was the fallback strategy used earlier?        |
| `Schema_Mismatches_003`    | **Data type mismatch**                    | Amend data type before load                  | May fail or cast based on type                   | Verify with dev team if data type mismatches can be injected easily. Any prior incidents?                  |
| `Schema_Mismatches_004`    | **Column order changed**                  | Change order before load                     | No impact; process succeeds                      | Confirm with devs if column reordering ever caused ingestion issues in the past.                           |
| `System_001`               | **Azure storage write failure**           | Simulate storage failure                     | Fails gracefully; alert raised                   | Ask if the team can simulate storage write errors or throttling in a safe test environment.                |
| `System_002`               | **Databricks cluster down** mid-ingestion | Bring down cluster mid-run                   | Fails gracefully; alert raised                   | Is it feasible to manually shut down cluster mid-load during testing? What happens to jobs in such cases?  |
| `System_003`               | **Insufficient compute**                  | Simulate low compute resources               | Fails gracefully; alert raised                   | Can resource quota be throttled in test? Have performance bottlenecks been observed before?                |
| `System_004`               | **Re-ingestion after failure**            | Retry after failure                          | Same batch loaded again correctly into Bronze    | Confirm if duplicate ingestion due to retries has been seen. What de-duplication strategy exists (if any)? |

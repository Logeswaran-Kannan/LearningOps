For Silver and Gold layers, setting up a production-like environment in the lower (test) environment would need several config changes and manual effort to sync the data like in production. Given the time and effort involved—and since this setup is only relevant for testing and not required in production—we’ve agreed to treat this as a technical-level change and accept the risk of keeping it out of scope for Phase 1. It’s more of a "nice to have" at this stage, and we plan to revisit and include it as part of Phase 2 for regression readiness.

Subject: Update: Error Handling Scenarios â€“ Outcome & Next Steps

Hi Team,

Following our discussion with the development team, we've reviewed and documented the actual outcomes for each of the identified error handling scenarios related to the Guidewire upgrade ingestion process.

Based on the inputs received:

I will update the test cases to reflect the pass status for scenarios that are working as expected.

For scenarios where observations differ from initial expectations, I will discuss the details further with Graham in our session tomorrow.

Any required actions or deviations will be tracked and addressed accordingly in JIRA.

Thanks again for your support and collaboration. Please feel free to reach out if you need access to the updated scenario sheet or have further inputs.

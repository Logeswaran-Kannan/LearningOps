Nothing major at the moment.

Paul and Simon are currently looking into the preprod data load issue. Paul mentioned there might be a timestamp format problem causing the load failure, and he’s investigating it now. We’ll be able to plan the dress rehearsal once that’s resolved.

For CDA, we had a discussion around the configuration of the data load to understand it from a testing perspective. Paul and Simon have addressed the queries Mani raised, and we're now working on aligning with the process.

Paul also helped me sort out a read issue on the Radar Live side, which is now resolved.

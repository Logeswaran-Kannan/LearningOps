I completely agree — the idea would definitely make things a lot smoother by reducing dependencies on shared folder access and cutting down on DevOps involvement for end users. But as you rightly pointed out, it does require proper assessment, permissions, and approvals.

In the meantime, we’ve gone ahead and raised a ServiceNow request for the shared folder access, which has already been approved by Phil. I believe the fulfillment is currently in progress.

Also, please find attached the script to connect to and read from Cosmos DB. Let me know if there’s anything else you’d need from my side.

Thanks again!

Hi Anthony,
I’m part of the BICOE Data Engineering team reporting to Hazel and Ho. I’m looking to get access to the SharePoint location where the project documents and trackers are maintained. Unfortunately, Hazel isn’t able to grant access, and it looks like you're listed as the owner of the site. Would you mind providing access when you get a chance? That’ll help me stay aligned with the ongoing work. Thanks in advance!

Subject: DDL Comparison Validation Results – Oracle vs Read Replica (PostgreSQL)

Hi Team,

As part of the database migration validation between Oracle and the PostgreSQL Read Replica (RR), we’ve completed the DDL comparison across environments. Below is a summary of the findings, captured in 7 key points:

Environments Used:
The comparison was performed using SYS9 for PC and BC, and UAT4 for CC on the Oracle side. For the RR side, we used STD001 for PC, BC, and CC. These are all test environments. No table exclusion filters were applied to ensure a full and accurate comparison.

Table Count Comparison:

Oracle: 5625 tables

Read Replica: 6090 tables
Out of the 6090 tables in RR, 737 are new tables not found in Oracle, while 5353 tables match by name with those in Oracle. This implies that 272 tables from Oracle are missing in the RR environment.

Investigation of Missing Tables (272):

118 tables (from Oracle) contain valid data and are missing in RR – these need further explanation.

154 tables have no data even on the Oracle side – may be safe to exclude.
We suspect some missing tables may be Oracle-specific technical/intermediate tables not required in RR, but this needs confirmation since we were not provided with a list of tables to exclude.

Column-Level Mismatches (in 5353 matched tables):

949 tables have structural mismatches.

231 columns exist in Oracle but are missing in RR.

2216 columns are additional in RR but not present in Oracle.
This discrepancy needs further investigation, especially around why existing Oracle columns were removed and new ones were added in RR without documented requirements.

Precision Mismatch:
One table was found with a precision-level mismatch. While this doesn’t appear to affect data, we’ve noted it for visibility.

New Tables in RR (737):
Of these, only 356 tables have any data. The remaining 381 tables contain zero records. These could be placeholders for future use or may lack test data at this stage. However, as there was no original requirement indicating the creation of these new tables, we would appreciate confirmation from the RR database team.

Next Steps:
All details regarding missing tables, additional tables, and column-level mismatches have been captured in the attached Excel file.
We're happy to walk through the results case-by-case to clarify and resolve outstanding items. Please let us know if further information is needed.

Thanks & regards,

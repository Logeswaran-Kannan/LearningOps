So just to confirm my understanding â€” when I interact with Athena, that triggers the Mule system, right? And Mule then feeds the MQS event hub. Meanwhile, Athena also sends data directly to the flow event hub.

So basically, every time I create a policy in Athena:

The flow interaction gets captured in flow.ehubstream, and

The related Rating, PreCom, and ML payloads are sent to the MQS event hub

Is that the right understanding?

Just a quick update on Rejani — her start date might be delayed due to a current health issue. We’re still waiting to get a confirmed date from her, but as of now, it’s a bit uncertain.

In the meantime, I’ve received an alternate profile: Jeevitha. She has strong hands-on experience in data engineering, especially around ADF ingestion and ETL processes. She’s also worked across both development and testing roles.

Would you be able to take a look at her profile as a backup option? It might be worth evaluating in case Rejani’s availability gets pushed out further.

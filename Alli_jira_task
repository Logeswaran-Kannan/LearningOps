üîß Functional Scope ‚Äì In Scope (One-line Statements)
Validate regression of existing MI pricing views post-MQS data integration.

Ensure accurate joins between MQS Quote IDs and legacy Quote/PRN references.

Verify format compatibility of MQS fields (e.g., date, numeric, string) with legacy view models.

Validate interaction-level reporting views still group and filter as expected.

Confirm continuity in decline metrics, quote journeys, and conversion KPIs.

Check mapping of MQS fields (Rating Response, Feature Set, etc.) into combined reporting layers.

Ensure MQS data does not break existing joins, filters, or aggregations in MI views.

Validate new MQS transaction records align with legacy transaction types for trend reporting.

üöÄ Non-Functional Scope ‚Äì In Scope (One-line Statements)
Validate performance of combined views post-MQS ingestion (no query failures or slowdowns).

Ensure row-level counts and summary KPIs reconcile pre/post MQS integration.

Validate data refresh/availability timing is consistent with legacy SLA (e.g., available by 9 AM).

Check audit trail/logging for MQS-enhanced views matches existing MI framework.

Confirm formatting changes in reports/dashboards (if any) do not affect data usability.

‚ùå Out-of-Scope
Standalone validation of MQS data sources (already validated upstream).

Business sign-off on decision-making accuracy (e.g., correct premium or risk score).

UI rendering or dashboard design changes.

Security, access control, or RBAC enforcement.

Real-time or streaming dashboards not tied to the batch EDM data model.

‚ö†Ô∏è Caveats / Assumptions
Assumes all MQS data is modeled correctly before MI view consumption.

Differences in volume/patterns are accepted if technically justifiable (e.g., new quoting logic).

Downstream consumers (e.g., dashboards) will revalidate post-MI SIT; MI focuses only on raw view behavior.

The test assumes EDM model is stable and properly versioned for MQS fields.

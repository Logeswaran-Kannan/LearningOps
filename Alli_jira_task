Subject: DDL Comparison – Oracle vs Read Replica (PostgreSQL) Validation Summary

Hi Team,

Please find below the summary of the validation results from the DDL comparison performed between the Oracle and Read Replica (PostgreSQL) databases as part of the migration validation exercise:

Environments Compared

Oracle: SYS9 for Policy Center (PC) and Billing Center (BC), and UAT4 for Claim Center (CC)

Read Replica (PostgreSQL): STD001 for PC, BC, and CC
Both are test environments. No table exclusion parameters were applied during comparison to ensure full visibility across all available objects.

Total Tables Identified

Oracle: 5,625 tables

Read Replica (RR): 6,090 tables
The RR set includes business data tables, technical process support tables, and intermediate tables.

Out of 6,090 RR tables, 737 are new (not found in Oracle)

5,353 tables have matching names between Oracle and RR

272 tables found in Oracle are missing in RR

Missing Tables Analysis (272 total)

Out of the 272 missing tables, 118 have valid data in Oracle and require further investigation.

154 tables hold no data even in Oracle.

For the 118 data-holding tables, we suspect some could be technical/intermediate tables used by Oracle but not required in RR. However, a clear explanation is needed, especially as there was no explicit requirement to exclude these tables.

Matching Tables (5,353 total) – Column-Level Mismatches

949 tables have column mismatches.

231 columns present in Oracle are missing in RR

2,216 columns are additional in RR but not present in Oracle
This needs further investigation, especially regarding whether these changes were intentional. Currently, there is no clear requirement justification for the removal or addition of these columns within existing tables.

Precision Mismatch Observation

One table was found to have a precision-level mismatch. While it may not affect data integrity, it’s noted here as an observation for completeness.

Analysis of the 737 New Tables in RR

Out of these, 356 tables contain valid data

381 tables have zero records
These might be placeholders for future use or simply lack test data at this stage. However, as per the initial expectation, no additional tables were planned, so confirmation is needed from the RR DB side regarding their purpose.

All detailed findings — including lists of missing and additional tables/columns — are available in the attached Excel sheet. Happy to walk through the results case-by-case to assist with analysis or resolution.

Let me know if any further clarification is needed.

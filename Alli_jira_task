✅ SIT Scope – Rating Response (EDM) Validation – MI Perspective
🪙 Silver Layer – Data Vault
🔧 Functional Validation
Validate successful ingestion of MQS Rating Response messages into the Silver Layer tables.

Confirm presence and mapping of core fields:

Quote ID, PRN, Cache ID, Decline Codes, Rating Premium, Adjustments

Validate schema structure aligns with Data Vault modeling standards (hub/link/sat).

Ensure all versions of Rating Responses (if re-quotes or updates) are stored with versioning and timestamps.

Validate referential integrity across Quote Domain, PreComp, and Core Risk data sets.

Confirm accurate decoding of raw error codes and decline codes for categorization.

Ensure data completeness across records — no nulls for critical fields (e.g., Quote ID, Premium).

Confirm Stop Quote and Failed Quote records are recorded with appropriate status.

🚀 Non-functional Validation
Confirm batch ingestion process completes within defined SLA (e.g., hourly or daily window).

Validate error logs and audit trails for each batch job.

Test data masking rules for sensitive fields where applicable.

Validate CDC or delta load works (i.e., no overwrite of historical data unless intended).

Ensure Silver layer supports downstream propagation to Gold without breaking schema.

🥇 Gold Layer – EDM (Enterprise Data Model)
🔧 Functional Validation
Validate transformation of Silver-layer Rating Response data into structured Gold-layer dimensional models.

Confirm mapping of:

Rating Premium

Decline Reasons (pre/post rating)

Endorsements

Payment Eligibility

Risk Score Outputs

Validate business aggregations (e.g., quote outcome summaries, decline trends).

Confirm Rating Response metrics are available and aligned to user domains:

Pricing, Underwriting, MI analysts

Validate that grouped decline codes (e.g., R001 = High Risk Area) appear consistently in the Gold EDM outputs.

Validate Stop Quote and Error Messages are correctly presented with context.

Confirm user-level access (RBAC) is enabled for domain-specific usage (e.g., pricing vs. MI).

🚀 Non-functional Validation
Validate daily refresh of Gold Layer with latest Silver inputs (T-1 data by 9 AM).

Confirm that dashboards using Gold data respond within acceptable time limits (query performance).

Validate audit logging for changes to the Rating Response Gold tables.

Confirm data is ready and validated for UAT/MI reporting workflows.

❌ Out-of-Scope Items
Upstream Precomp scoring logic or pricing algorithm correctness.

UI rendering of quote response or stop quote messages.

Integration of Rating Response with claims or policy administration systems.

Real-time data loads or Kafka/EventHub flows (only batch data scope is included).

Downstream external report validation in Power BI/Looker unless explicitly linked to Gold Layer fields.

⚠️ Caveats
Business meaning and justification of decline codes must be validated by UAT teams, not MI QA.

The presence of Rating Response data does not confirm quote success — only its availability for reporting.

Versioning logic is expected to be handled within Silver; QA assumes this is implemented.

CDC/Delta processing is assumed to preserve history unless flagged otherwise.

👥 Business Scenario View (UAT-Aligned)
Scenario	Layer	Who Validates	What to Validate
Stop Quotes are captured and traceable	Silver	MI QA + UAT	Failed quotes are logged and linked
Rating Response aligns with Quote ID & Cache ID	Silver & Gold	MI QA	Referential joins are correct
Daily refreshed Rating Response is available in reports	Gold	MI QA	T-1 quote responses are visible by 9 AM
Decline codes are grouped into reporting categories	Gold	UAT	Declines appear under correct business logic
U/W team can extract rating outcome & quote error	Gold	UAT + MI	Complete visibility for MI insights
Pre vs Post Decline analysis supported in reporting	Gold	UAT	Decline reasons separated and traceable
Rating Premium adjustments appear in analytics	Gold	MI QA	Accurate values for reporting dashboards

✅ SIT Test Scope – Rating Response (EDM)
Focus: MI team's technical validation

🧱 SILVER LAYER – Data Vault (Staging of Rating Response)
🔧 Functional Validation
Validate ingestion of Rating Response messages into structured Data Vault model.

Confirm presence of all mandatory fields: Quote ID, PRN, Cache ID, Decline Flags, Rating Codes, Error Codes.

Validate mapping of quote-level decisions (e.g., acceptance, decline, technical failure) into hub/satellite tables.

Verify schema versioning (if applicable) is handled without loss of prior versions.

Confirm referential links to Quote Request, Feature Set, and Core Risk entities.

🚀 Non-Functional Validation
Validate schema evolution support (e.g., new decline types or adjustment fields).

Confirm Silver table updates are incremental and processed daily.

Check row-level timestamp tracking for changes (created/updated_at).

Validate row count accuracy compared to expected source counts.

🔍 Business Scenario Alignment (Staging Layer Only)
Quote Use Case	What Silver Layer Should Reflect
NB Quote	Captures full rating response (accept/decline) from MQS
Requote	Stores new response version with same Cache ID, updated values
MTA	Shows updated response, references prior quote version
MTA Requote	Maintains linked history for chain of events via Cache ID

⭐ GOLD LAYER – EDM (Reporting & Analytics)
🔧 Functional Validation
Validate transformation of Silver Rating Response into Gold dimensional models.

Confirm decline codes are correctly grouped using reference mappings (e.g., R001: High Risk Area).

Ensure dimensions like Decline Reason, System Error, Adjustment Applied, Discounts, and Risk Score are populated.

Verify that quotes with multiple attempts (re-quotes) are aggregated logically for reporting.

Ensure quote journey linkages (via Cache ID) support full history views.

🚀 Non-Functional Validation
Confirm daily refresh and data cut-off logic (e.g., prior day data available by 9 AM).

Validate performance of dashboard/reporting queries using Rating Response data.

Ensure masking of any sensitive data fields (PRN, customer keys) as per MI access controls.

Audit and traceability: Confirm logging of data loads and field-level lineage.

🔍 Business Scenario Alignment (Analytics/Reporting Layer)
Quote Use Case	Expected Output in EDM
NB Quote	Quote rated, response stored, decline reason visible (if declined)
Requote	Prior quote retained, new quote response shown, linked via Cache ID
MTA	Updated response appears as new record, previous retained for historical analysis
MTA Requote	Chain of quotes presented in timeline using Cache ID and PRN

❌ Out-of-Scope (Rating Response EDM)
No testing of Pricing Engine/ML scoring logic

No UI rendering/portal-level validations

No downstream operational systems beyond EDM

Real-time event delivery (only batch refresh tested)

Business-level validation of decision accuracy or rating logic (Pricing team’s scope)

⚠️ Caveats
Quote journey context (Cache ID → PRN mappings) must be tested jointly with Quote/Precomp datasets.

MI validation does not ensure correctness of decline reason — only presence and grouping.

Any errors not structurally exposed by MQS cannot be traced/tested from EDM.

Technical error logging visibility is limited to what is captured in Rating Response payload.

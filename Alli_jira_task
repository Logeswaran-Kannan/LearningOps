Radar Live ‚Äì Enrichment Scope Clarification (ODS Layer)
üîπ Component: Bronze Layer ‚Äì ODS ‚Äì Raw Enrichments
Reference: S2

üìå Key Points Interpreted from the Design:
Raw enrichment data is part of the MQS Quote Request message.

These enrichments are compressed and must be decompressed and stored in their original form in the ODS layer.

These enrichment values are not currently used by downstream layers like Data Vault or EDM.

Note from design: "Should the DE data be validated? Assume not!" ‚Äî which strongly implies exclusion from immediate QA validation.

‚úÖ Testing Scope (Minimal)
In Scope:
Storage Format Validation: Confirm that raw enrichment data is successfully decompressed and stored in the Bronze/ODS layer in its original form.

Field Presence Check: Ensure metadata and enrichment blocks are included in the MQS Quote Request payload and persisted as-is.

Decompression Confirmation: Validate that enrichment compression logic is reversible and content is accessible post-landing.

‚ùå Out of Scope:
No content-level validation of enrichment data fields (e.g., business logic, correctness of individual enrichment attributes like DVLA, Core Risk, etc.).

No functional validation of how enrichment data is consumed, since it is not used for any active decisioning or transformations at this stage.

No validations in Data Vault or EDM involving enrichment data.

‚ö†Ô∏è Caveat (To Add in Test Plan)
Enrichment data within the ODS (Raw Bronze) layer is validated only to the extent of landing, decompression, and availability.
Field-level or business rule validation of enrichment data is explicitly out of scope, as this data is not yet consumed downstream by any decisioning logic or reporting layer.

There’s a defect raised on MQSQuoteIds in SIT coming through without the “MQS” prefix. Alison mentioned this is intentional in pre-prod to help distinguish mock IDs from real ones, and adding the prefix could risk mixing them if switching occurs.

From our side, we originally asked for the prefix to be added for consistency with downstream expectations.

Could I please get your views on whether SIT should follow the pre-prod approach (no prefix) or align to the full MQS prefix format? Just want to ensure we proceed correctly.

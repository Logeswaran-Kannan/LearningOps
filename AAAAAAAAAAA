We’re seeing some Interaction records where the MQSQuoteID is coming through without the ‘MQS’ prefix. Our expectation was that MQSQuoteID should always start with “MQS”, so we wanted to check whether these are considered valid records.

At the moment, these MQSQuoteIDs without the prefix also don’t appear to have any corresponding MQS data in the MQS flow, which is why we’re unsure if they’re mock IDs or something else.

Test Details – Data Quality Test Case Identification & Execution

Objective:
Identify key business-critical columns across all message types and validate that data quality rules applied post-load do not cause any functional or volume impact to downstream data pipelines. These test cases will form part of the regression pack for post-live checkout.

Scope:

All message types processed by the pipeline (e.g., New Business, Mid-Term Adjustment, Renewal, Cancellation, etc.)

Validation of important business columns such as identifiers, financial fields, status indicators, and mandatory reference data.

Verification that DQ checks do not block or alter valid data during end-to-end load.

Test Approach:

Identify Important Columns:

Review schema for each message type.

Highlight columns that are business-critical (e.g., MQSQuoteId, product reference, premium amounts, effective dates).

Prioritise columns with dependency across upstream/downstream systems.

Design Data Quality Test Cases:

Positive: Valid/expected values must pass without rejecting or modifying records.

Negative: Nulls, incorrect formats, or invalid values should trigger expected DQ behaviour.

Edge Cases: Optional fields, default values, prefix rules (e.g., MQS prefix), datatype variations.

Execution:

Inject controlled test data covering all scenarios.

Validate that pipeline loads data successfully without volume drop or schema impact.

Confirm DQ rules log or flag errors correctly without blocking business-critical flows.

Outcome Expected:

Assurance that DQ rules do not break or interrupt daily processing.

Stable baseline test pack for future regression, ensuring post-live changes do not impact critical columns or load behaviour.

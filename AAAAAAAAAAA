UAT Sign-off Request – LRT Active/Passive Switch (BICoE Data Pipeline)

Hi Team,

As part of the LRT Active/Passive switch, the BICoE data pipeline activities have been completed and the handover and support from the BICoE side have been marked as complete.

From our validation, the data ingestion pipeline is functioning as expected and the Active/Passive switch is working correctly from a BICoE data pipeline perspective. Based on our discussions, RL-1448 appears to be related to behaviour outside of the BICoE data pipeline scope.

Could you please confirm UAT completion and provide sign-off for the BICoE data pipeline component? This will allow us to formally close testing for this component from the BICoE side.

Please let us know if any additional clarification is required.

Thanks, <your name>

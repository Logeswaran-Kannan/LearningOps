Hi team,

From the pipeline side we have verified that the data ingestion and the Active/Passive Cosmos DB switch performed by BICOE is working as expected. The Radar microservices are picking up the correct active database after the switch.

However, the behaviour you are seeing via SOAP UI appears to be coming through the Product Adapter layer. SOAP UI calls go through the adapter, which may still be pointing to the previous database or using an outdated connection reference. This would explain why the response differs from what we validate directly in Cosmos DB after the switch.

At this stage there is no indication of an issue in the ingestion pipeline itself. It would be helpful if a defect could be raised on the Product Adapter side so the correct team can investigate the connection being used.

Rob is currently on sick leave, but once he is back I will reconfirm the details with him as well.

Let me know if you need any further information from the pipeline side.

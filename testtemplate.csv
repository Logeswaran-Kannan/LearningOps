Test Case,Description,Steps,Expected Result
Duplicate Data Check,Verify if there are any duplicate records in the table.,"1. Retrieve the count of distinct records.<br>2. Retrieve the count of all records.<br>3. Compare the counts.<br>4. If the counts match, there are no duplicates. Otherwise, duplicates exist.",Count of distinct records matches the count of all records.
Source Minus Target Comparison,Compare the data in the source table with the data in the target table to identify missing records in the target.,"1. Retrieve the count of records in the source table.<br>2. Retrieve the count of records in the target table.<br>3. Compare the counts.<br>4. If the count of the target table is less than the source table, there are missing records.",Count of records in the target table is equal to or greater than the count of records in the source table.
Null Check,Validate if any required columns have null values in the table.,"1. Identify the required columns in the table.<br>2. Retrieve the count of records where any required column is null.<br>3. If the count is zero, there are no null values in required columns. Otherwise, there are null values.",Count of records with null values in required columns is zero.
Data Consistency Check,Ensure the data in specific columns adheres to predefined constraints or business rules.,"1. Define the constraints or rules to be validated.<br>2. Apply the constraints or rules on the relevant columns.<br>3. Retrieve the count of records that violate the constraints or rules.<br>4. If the count is zero, the data is consistent. Otherwise, there are inconsistencies.",Count of records violating constraints or rules is zero.
Data Completeness Check,Verify if all expected columns are present in the table.,"1. Define the expected columns in the table.<br>2. Retrieve the list of columns in the table.<br>3. Compare the expected columns with the actual columns.<br>4. If all expected columns are present, the data is complete. Otherwise, there are missing columns.",All expected columns are present in the table.

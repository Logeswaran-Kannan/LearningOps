 Notify Azure Infra team to prepare for source switch.

‚úÖ AZ Infra / Source Team

 Confirm switch-over script/process is in place for Guidewire data source redirection.

‚úÖ QA / Validation Teams
 Ensure test datasets, use cases, and checkpoints are documented.

 Finalize baseline validation templates for post-switch comparison.

‚úÖ Checkpoints
 Pre-implementation checkpoint call (Dry Run Kickoff).

 Checklist review: Access, code deployments, scripts, comms sent, backout prep.

üîÅ 2. Implementation Phase
‚úÖ AZ Infra / Source Team
 Switch Guidewire source system from legacy Oracle to new Cloud version.

 Confirm handshake and readiness signal to BICOE after switch.

‚úÖ BICOE Tasks
 Manually trigger data pipelines from PROD ADF using new linked service.

 Monitor initial data load ‚Äì ensure expected volume, schema match, and no critical failures.

 Validate schema of data ingested from PROD Read Replica.

 Run smoke test scripts on Databricks against new data.

‚úÖ QA / Validation Teams
 Execute post-switch validation tests for key tables.

 Confirm format, record counts, null checks, and known defects.

‚úÖ Checkpoints
 Mid-implementation checkpoint call: Confirm source switched, data flow started, initial load healthy.

üß™ 3. Post-Implementation Phase
‚úÖ BICOE Tasks
 Full health check on Azure Data Factory, Databricks pipelines, and data completeness.

 Confirm metadata syncs (schemas, tables, logs).

 Run full smoke test and record results.

 Compare against historical data snapshots.

‚úÖ Downstream Impact & Communications
 Notify downstream teams (e.g., Marketing, MI, SPV, etc.) of data availability status.

 Confirm any temporary pauses (e.g., SPV team processing) are lifted with timing clarity.

 Document any new issues/defects and their mitigation steps.

‚úÖ Backout Planning (if triggered)
 Revert ADF linked service to legacy Oracle if major failure.

 Manually resume pipelines from fallback.

 Run backout smoke test scripts to confirm legacy source data intact.

 Communicate backout success to all teams and stakeholders.

‚úÖ Checkpoints
 Post-implementation checkpoint call: Validate system health, test results, defects.

 Backout window checkpoint (only if required).

‚úÖ 4. Closure Activities
‚úÖ All Teams
 Final dry run test results shared and signed off.

 Update runbook with learnings and issue logs.

 Submit change tasks closure in ServiceNow.

 Update rollback plan based on lessons from dry run.

 Confirm availability for production cutover readiness.

‚úÖ Change Management
 Finalize and document dry run outcome.

 Update RFC notes with successful execution and checklist.

 Confirm Go/No-Go criteria for production deployment.

‚úÖ Final Checkpoint
 Closure checkpoint call: Dry run wrap-up, post-mortem items, Go-Live prep.

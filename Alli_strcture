1. Document Purpose
This Test Summary Report (TSR) presents a consolidated overview of the test execution activities, outcomes, and quality assessment conducted as part of Phase 1 of the Guidewire Data Migration project. This phase specifically focuses on the Read Replica-based ingestion validation for migrating data from the legacy Oracle source systems to the Azure Data Lake platform.

The purpose of this report is to:

Summarize the validation activities completed for the Read Replica ingestion flow.

Provide key findings, defects, risks, and acceptance criteria.

Present a formal recommendation regarding the readiness of the Read Replica ingestion process for production release.

2. Introduction
The Guidewire Data Migration project is transitioning the existing data ingestion process from on-premises Oracle databases to a cloud-native architecture leveraging Azure Data Lake, Databricks, and Read Replica PostgreSQL sources. The full migration strategy involves two key phases:

Phase 1: Interim solution using Read Replica as the ingestion source.

Phase 2 (Future): Final ingestion using Cloud Data Access (CDA) files from Amazon S3.

This report pertains only to Phase 1, which focuses exclusively on testing and validating the ingestion and transformation of Guidewire data — specifically from PolicyCenter, BillingCenter, and ClaimCenter — via the Read Replica into the Bronze Layer of the Azure Data Lake.

Testing was conducted using a Databricks-based automation framework, integrated with Azure DevOps for pipeline execution and defect tracking. Manual data checks and three-way reconciliation were also performed in collaboration with BICOE and the business QA team.

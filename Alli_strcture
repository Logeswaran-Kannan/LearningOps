Hi Graham,

I’ve updated the checklist for the release activity — could you please take a look and let me know if I’ve missed anything? I haven’t filled in the task duration and timing yet, as that would need to align with the overall release plan. If you get a chance to add that part based on the broader timeline, that would be great.

Looking forward to your feedback!

Thanks,

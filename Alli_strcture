Hi [Team Member's Name],

We’re getting close to test closure, and there are questions being raised from the signoff side. I need your updates on the below tasks as soon as possible:

TSR from an automation perspective: I need confirmation on the number of successful scheduled runs.

Review completion with the project team on automation framework readiness against requirements – plan this for Monday so we can get a consistent 3-day result set.

Smoke test readiness for release – please review this with Graham and Suraj and have it finalized before Tuesday.

Test coverage and completion – ensure this is reflected in Jira and aligned with the requirement. This needs to be closed in line with the test plan.

Smoke test readiness for production – complete the review and get the signoff.

Silver automation completion level – where do we stand?

Performance benchmark for automation runs – share the numbers.

Let me know if anything is blocked or needs support, but please treat this as high priority.

Thanks,

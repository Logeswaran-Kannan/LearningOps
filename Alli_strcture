Subject: Follow-up & MoM: Ingestion Test Scenario Walkthrough

Hi Team,

Thanks everyone for joining today‚Äôs session.

Below are the key points and minutes from our walkthrough of the ingestion validation test scenarios:

‚úÖ Agenda Recap:
Walked through the end-to-end technical test scenarios covering both streaming sources (EventHub) and file-based sources.

Reviewed the Confluence page, which outlines:

Scope and objective of validation

Testing options and assumptions

Success criteria and validation methods

üí¨ Discussion & Feedback:
Test coverage was acknowledged as comprehensive and aligned with data quality standards.

Open questions were identified:

Handling of out-of-sequence messages needs further clarification, especially around business expectations.

Need to confirm whether upstream systems (e.g., Athena/Mule) have accessible data stores or logs to support reconciliation.

It was agreed that the current scenarios focus solely on technical ingestion validation. We‚Äôll need to prepare a UAT-oriented Data Scenario Document separately for business-level data flow validation.

A follow-up is required with Nikki to address assumptions and handling rules related to data transformation and enrichment.

üìù Next Steps:
Capture and publish the open questions in the same Confluence page.

Assign ownership to follow up with relevant teams for resolution.

Start drafting the Data Scenario Document for UAT.

Schedule a clarification session with Nikki on data handling.

Let me know if you‚Äôd like to add anything I‚Äôve missed.

Summary Results of Sanity Check:

The majority (80%) of the data received in the mart belongs to web users, and as designed, these data are filtered in the report. Additionally, there have been 35 valid motor sales by agents from 31/3/2023 to the present date.

Except for a known issue related to province codes, there doesn't appear to be any valid offline sales during this period. It seems that even web users are categorized as quotes generated by agents. This contradicts what we observed in the test environment, and further discussions with Vinod suggest that these key performance indicators (KPIs) will not populate with valid values in this scenario.

Some default records are missing in the reference dimension tables, which were correctly set in the test environment.

The sales count matches for a sample agent; however, there is a discrepancy in the addon count between the mart and the report.

Today, two sales records were received in the incremental data load.

Please review these results and take necessary actions for resolution and further investigation as needed.

Hey team,

Hope you're all doing well! As we have successfully released our TS01 into the live environment, it's time to shift our focus towards TS02. Based on our discussions on the scope and timeline of TS02 over the past week, I kindly request everyone, including the business and architecture teams, to review the updated TS02 Test Plan.

Could you please provide your valuable comments on the SharePoint document by 16th June? This will help us ensure alignment with our new hub structure and proceed smoothly with the testing phase.

Thanks in advance for your cooperation!

Cheers,

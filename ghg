I wanted to inform you that both Keasava and Akshay are currently on leave today. They are the ones who have the necessary licenses and have configured all the setups. I was wondering if there is any way we can proceed with the debug session even without their support?

Additionally, I am uncertain about their specific role in this debug session. Akshay mentioned that the comparison issue is now occurring less frequently. Are they expected to write Selenium code for this? If so, they have already mentioned that they lack expertise in that area. As I mentioned before, our team is capable of maintaining the code and accommodating small changes. However, if there are any changes to the codebase, that would require involvement from a cross-functional team.

Moreover, the team is currently spending a significant amount of time on maintenance activities due to the frequent changes in the report URLs and other visual aspects. We are also facing the challenge of integrating new reports, which diverts the team's focus from tool maintenance. As a result, we have decided to shift our regression scope to Mart tables, where all the reports are connected under DevOps automation. We are currently discussing and finalizing this approach.

Please let me know your thoughts on these matters.

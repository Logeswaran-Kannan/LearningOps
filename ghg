I hope you're all doing well. I wanted to inform you that we have a new team member, Suttapa, joining our project. Sujatha mentioned that Suttapa did some excellent work in the previous project.

To ensure a smooth onboarding process, I kindly request that you begin providing knowledge transfer (KT) to Suttapa starting from Monday. Please make the necessary arrangements to grant her the required access.

Let's extend a warm welcome to Suttapa and support her in getting up to speed with our project.

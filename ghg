Hello team,

Following our discussion during the morning defect triage, I am summarizing the null issue into the following categories:

Table A and B: Both tables are not receiving any data from the source CDL itself. Vinod is currently investigating this with the source CDL team, and we are tracking it under defect ID DCD-43558.

Key Grain Columns: Out of the 14 tables, 13 tables have null values in one or more of their key grain columns. This creates difficulties in testing and validating the tables as it leads to duplicates. Approximately 14% of the columns have either 100% null or only zero values, as updated by Jeelani in the attached sheet. We are tracking this issue under DCD-43612.

Please review the details mentioned above, and let me know if any additional information or action is required from your end.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

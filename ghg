Has the full data not been stored in any of our bronze tables? If it is available, we can merge the data into the current schema and proceed with the analytical processing. However, if the full data is not present, we have no choice but to request CDL to reprocess the data once again. Relying solely on the 7 days' worth of incremental data might not be sufficient to cover all the test scenarios adequately.

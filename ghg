Thank you for sharing the detailed information with us. I concur that this is a significant transformation at the platform level. However, in order to proceed with the change release process, the change control team will need a test summary report to be appended to the change release request. Akshay from the testing team will be responsible for documenting the benchmark before and after the change in the TEST/DEV environment, enabling him to generate a simplified version of the TSR specifically for this alteration.

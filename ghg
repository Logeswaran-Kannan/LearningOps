During the testing phase, we encountered several concerns and challenges that impacted our testing efforts. Here is a retrospective summary of the key issues:

High Level of Design Change and Unstable Documentation:

The project experienced frequent design changes, resulting in an unstable set of related documents.
This led to a significant effort in adapting and updating our test designs to align with the evolving requirements.
Platform Issues in Test Environment:

We faced challenges related to access and resource quota in the Databricks test environment.
Limited access rights and insufficient resources hindered our testing activities and caused delays.
Timeline Delays:

The project timeline was revised multiple times due to delays in the build, design, and platform setup.
These delays significantly compressed our testing timeline, causing pressure to complete testing within a limited timeframe.
Incomplete Business Requirement Document and Impact Analysis:

The business requirement document provided was incomplete and lacked clarity.
The impact analysis performed by the data analyst and designer was inadequate, resulting in unclear reporting requirements and potential compatibility issues between the legacy and current systems.
Inadequate Test Data Readiness Analysis:

The analysis of test data readiness was not fully conducted, leading to unexpected source data issues during testing.
Insufficient preparation and validation of test data impacted the reliability and accuracy of our testing results.
To mitigate these challenges in future testing phases, it is recommended to address the stability of design and related documentation early in the project, establish clear communication channels with the platform team to resolve environment issues promptly, and prioritize thorough business requirement documentation and impact analysis. Additionally, a comprehensive test data readiness analysis should be performed to ensure sufficient and reliable test data availability.

By addressing these areas, we can enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of our testing processes and minimize disruptions caused by unforeseen challenges.

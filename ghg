Open Issues Details: One of the questions raised is related to the open issues. Kesava is the primary person who can provide more information about these issues. As per the previous recommendation from Applitool, they suggested trying to recreate the comparison issues using Selenium code. However, since this issue doesn't occur frequently, the team has not yet attempted this approach. In the upcoming meeting, we will highlight this issue and discuss the potential solution.

Expertise Level and Code Walkthrough: The second question pertains to the current expertise level of the team. It's important to note that the team has exposure to only a few code areas where they can make small modifications. Conducting a comprehensive code walkthrough with Applitool might not be feasible at this stage. We will communicate this limitation during the demo session and focus on utilizing the team's expertise to explore the areas they are familiar with.


eam Expertise Level: Currently, the team has limited exposure to specific code areas where they can make small modifications. However, they are not yet in a position to provide a walkthrough of the entire codebase integrated with Applitools. This limitation may impact their ability to fully explore and understand the capabilities and potential of Applitools during the demo session.

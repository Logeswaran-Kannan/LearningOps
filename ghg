Push Changes to DevOps Repository
Once the test cases have been written, we need to push the changes back to the DevOps repository.

To commit the changes, navigate to the Changes section in the Team Explorer tab, enter a commit message, and click the Commit All button. Once the changes have been committed, click the Sync button and select the Push option to push the changes to the remote repository.

Create a Build Pipeline
Now that the changes have been pushed to the repository, we need to create a build pipeline to deploy the workflow in the Databricks test environment and run the test cases. To create a build pipeline, navigate to the Pipelines section of the Azure DevOps project and click the New pipeline button. Select the repository that was just created and choose the template for Python.

Configure Build Pipeline
Once the pipeline is created, we need to configure it to deploy the workflow in the Databricks test environment and run the test cases. This can be done by adding the necessary steps to the pipeline. Here is an example pipeline:

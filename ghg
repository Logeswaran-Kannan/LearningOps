I have compiled a list of KPIs in B2A that are derived from the fact motor sales table in the B2A report dataset. It's important to note that this list only includes attributes that are within the scope of the respective releases. If you require the full list of attributes, I suggest reaching out to Vinod or Guy as they are the appropriate individuals to provide that information.

During my discussion with Sujatha, it became clear that Vinod will be performing a similar activity for TS02. According to Sujatha's conversation with Waiman, attribute prioritization based on release scope KPIs cannot be performed because the tables used for release-specific purposes may also be used for other reports. However, if you are gathering this list for local prioritization purposes, it is acceptable. From a build and testing perspective, there is no prioritization of attributes based on release scope, at least based on my understanding.

Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with.

Best regards,

Well done to all team members who have given a demo on test case of null check using pytest assert function in the system test framework. Your efforts and contributions to the project are greatly appreciated.

For those who have not yet given a demo, I encourage you to do so as soon as possible. Demonstrating your knowledge and skills not only benefits the team, but it also helps you grow as a professional. So, let's keep up the good work and continue to collaborate and share our expertise.

Question 1: Can we request the design (LLD) to be kept static before starting the testing phase?

Answer: Since this is an Agile-based project, it is expected that the LLD (Low-Level Design) may be updated during the build and testing phases. However, if there are frequent changes to the design and requirements during the testing phase, it should be escalated to the head of design and architect for further consideration and resolution.

Question 2: We have challenges in coordination within the team, such as seat booking, security issues, network issues, and meeting schedules.

Answer: Understandably, there may be challenges as the team starts working from the office. To address these issues:

Seat booking, security, and network issues can be reported to Amber, who can assist in rectifying them.
For meeting schedules, it is important to attend defect triage and project standup meetings on alternate days, as they are mandatory for offshore team members until defects contain all necessary details to be covered from onshore.
It has been suggested to replace the morning connect of 15 minutes with an end-of-day (EOD) status call to track status and discuss any blockers. The timing for the EOD status call can be adjusted for the current release.
The duration of the EOD status call should be kept concise and focused on collecting status rather than turning into an analysis call. It would be more effective to perform analysis during offshore hours.
Question 3: Is there a shifting option available?

Answer: No, there is no official shifting option available. Although some team members may have connected during onshore hours in the past based on flexible hours, it is advisable to discuss the possibility with Amber or Sujatha. However, it is expected that team members follow the organization's policy and be available during the committed time.

Question 4: Can we get a treat from onshore, as other projects have?

Answer: The test manager will discuss this with others and provide an update on the possibility of receiving a treat from onshore. It would be beneficial to foster a positive team dynamic and acknowledge the efforts of the offshore team members.

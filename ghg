I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to bring your attention to the upcoming deadline for producing the Test Summary Report (TSR) by next Monday. In order to meet this deadline, we need the following line items to be completed on schedule:

Silver Incremental Data Load Defect: We still have one defect related to the silver incremental data load. The development team is planning to address this issue today, and we hope that the fix will resolve the problem.

Report Validation and Mart Validation: We have planned to complete the first round of report validation and Mart validation by today, the 15th.

Open S1 and S2 Defect Fixes: All open S1 and S2 defects must be delivered to the testing team without fail by the 16th.

E2E Testing and Defect Revalidation: On the 17th and 18th, we will solely focus on E2E testing and defect revalidation. Any defects that are reopened or new findings in E2E testing need to be closed during this window itself. We urge the development team to perform E2E testing as early as possible, even if it means identifying issues that give us some time to resolve them. Please note that this window is only a baseline, and if the development team is ready to enable E2E orchestration even today, the testing team will start validation.

Backup Day: The 8th is being kept as a backup day to ensure that any slips in the above plan can be handled effectively. If there are any deviations from the above plan, they will be treated as risks to producing the TSR on time.

Additionally, I would like to inform you that we are currently performing risk-based validation, which means we have reduced our test coverage to prioritize the most critical test cases. This approach has been adopted considering the limited timescale we have to complete TS01 testing.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns regarding these requirements. I appreciate your support in ensuring that we meet the deadline for the Test Summary Report.

Thank you.

As this is a test environment and we don't have real users or agents coming through CDL as in the production system, it has been decided to create manipulated test data in both DIM_EMPLOYEE and DIM_CONTACT_CENTRE_EMP tables. Afterward, we will refresh the Fact tables to ensure they contain some data. It is expected that the fact table refresh will be completed before today. Adelina will confirm this.

In addition to Mahesh's comment, there is a defect (DCD-38136) related to missing history data in the goldpolicy.dim_employee table. The defect is currently under analysis, and I will provide an update once there is more information available.

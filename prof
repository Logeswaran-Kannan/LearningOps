I would like to provide my feedback on Aki's performance during this year-end appraisal. Aki has played a significant role in developing the SIT framework, showcasing a strong learning attitude and taking full responsibility for the tasks assigned to him. His proficiency in Python scripting has been particularly commendable. He has already demonstrated the capabilities expected at the associate level.

Furthermore, Aki possesses the potential to develop automation models that add value to our business, aligning with our H2 goals. This is an area where we have high expectations from him and the team shares the same sentiment. It would greatly benefit the team if Aki could address the comments provided by his fellow team members. I recommend having a conversation with him regarding his expectations moving forward.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

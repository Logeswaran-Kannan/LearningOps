Since this issue is specific to the production environment and related to the deployment process, it is necessary to understand how to recreate the same scenario in a lower environment. Typically, in a full refresh, the existing records should be removed before processing new ones, but this step was overlooked. We need to manually perform the deletion process. However, replicating this scenario in a testing environment poses a challenge in terms of test data. The only feasible option is to recreate it by adding manipulated test data to the DIM_EMPLOYEE table.

I recall our discussions regarding certain defects, particularly S1 defect - DCD-44457, and a couple of S2 defects (DCD-43777 and DCD-44498). In those conversations, we addressed the issue of RTPLOG_ID being populated as null. It is my understanding that the proposed solution to address this issue is to populate the RTPLOG_ID field with either the transaction ID or result ID wherever it is currently null. This proposed solution is intended to be applied across all CORE and SI tables.

At present, these mentioned defects are in an open state and may be awaiting revalidation following the implementation of the post-1st July data filter. I believe that this situation aligns with the context we discussed earlier. If, however, this scenario falls outside the scope of our prior discussions, please let me know, and I will be ready to create a separate defect to address the new situation.

As a tester working with a development team in Azure DevOps platform, there are several ways to collaborate and ensure a successful delivery of high-quality software. Here are some technical details about the ways of working as a tester with the development team in Azure DevOps:

Collaborate on requirements: Testers and developers should collaborate on requirements to ensure that all user stories have been adequately defined, and all acceptance criteria are clearly specified. Testers can provide valuable input on the requirements, identifying potential gaps or areas that may require additional testing.

Participate in sprint planning: Testers should participate in sprint planning sessions to ensure that testing tasks are identified and planned for during the sprint. Testers can help identify testing tasks, estimate testing efforts, and provide input on the test environment and test data requirements.

Use Azure Test Plans: Azure Test Plans is a built-in solution in Azure DevOps for managing tests and tracking test results. Testers can use Azure Test Plans to create, manage, and run test cases and report bugs. The test results can then be reviewed by the development team to identify and address issues.

Use continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines: CI/CD pipelines are essential for automating the build, test, and deployment process. Testers can collaborate with developers to ensure that all necessary tests are included in the CI/CD pipeline and that the pipeline runs smoothly.

Provide timely feedback: Testers should provide timely feedback to developers on issues and defects. This feedback should be provided as soon as possible to ensure that issues are addressed quickly and that the software is delivered on time.

Monitor and track progress: Testers should monitor and track the progress of testing activities and report on the testing status regularly. This can help identify issues or delays and provide feedback to the development team.

Work with developers on test automation: Test automation is critical for efficient and effective testing. Testers and developers can collaborate on test automation efforts, identifying areas where automation can improve testing efficiency and accuracy.

In conclusion, as a tester working with a development team in Azure DevOps platform, collaboration and communication are key. Using the right tools and processes can ensure that testing is thorough, efficient, and effective. By working closely with the development team, testers can ensure that software is delivered on time, with high quality, and meets the needs of end-users.

Regarding S1 defect - DCD-44457 and a couple of S2 defects (DCD-43777 and DCD-44498), our discussions revolved around the issue of RTPLOG_ID being populated as null. As a potential solution to address this problem, it was suggested that we replace RTPLOG_ID with a combination of the transaction ID and result ID. This proposed fix is intended to be applied across all CORE and SI tables. These defects are currently in an open state and might be awaiting revalidation post the 1st of July data filter.

I believe that this situation likely falls within the same context. If it's determined that this is not the case, kindly let me know, and I can initiate a separate defect to address this issue.

Thank you, Abinaya, for your adhoc support last Friday. In your absence, Sutapa will take care of the remaining validations.

Nishant, Abinaya informed me that we don't need to perform schema comparison for this regression validation. Could you please provide some insights into the specific reasons why automated schema comparison is not required in this case? If possible, could you guide us on how to perform automated schema comparison and share the process with Sutapa? This would greatly assist her in conducting the comparison efficiently.

Sujatha, could you kindly share the high-level design document for this change? Having access to the document will help us understand how the historic and upgraded files will be handled in production, ensuring a better grasp of the overall process.

Your collaboration and support are much appreciated. If you have any updates or additional information, please don't hesitate to share it with the team.

Adelina, I wanted to inform you that the manual test data has been successfully added to the dim_employee and dim_contact_centre_emp tables in the Synapse database. Now, we need to proceed with the following steps:

Refresh the goldpolicy.dim_policy table, ensuring that historic data is included.
Perform a refresh of the fact tables.
This time, we should have data available for the agents.
Once the refresh is complete, please notify Guy about the status. Thank you!

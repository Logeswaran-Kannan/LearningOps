ID / Name,Scenario Description,Simulation Method,Expected Outcome,Actual Outcome,Comments,Checkpoint with Development Team,Predicted Impact if Occurs in Production
Source System Issues_001,Source data is unavailable,Simulate total unavailability before RR load,Fails gracefully; alert raised,,,"Please confirm whether you were able to simulate this scenario in the test environment or have encountered it previously. If so, how was it resolved or what process was followed?","ODS ingestion will fail, and downstream data may be missing. Monitoring alerts should trigger. Manual intervention likely required."
Source System Issues_002,Source data is partially available,Simulate partial unavailability,Fails gracefully; alert raised,,,"Please confirm if partial data loads can be simulated in the test environment. If youâ€™ve encountered this issue before, how did you manage it? If not, is there a fallback or mitigation plan?",Partial data ingestion may cause inconsistent or incomplete downstream data. Could lead to inaccurate reporting until rectified.
Connectivity_001,Network is down,Simulate network downtime before load,Fails gracefully; alert raised,,,"Please confirm if you can simulate a network outage in lower environments. If this has occurred before, what steps were taken to handle it, and is a mitigation process defined?","Ingestion will halt, triggering alerts. No data will be written until connectivity is restored, potentially causing SLA breaches."
Connectivity_002,Invalid credentials,Use invalid auth for RR load,Fails gracefully; alert raised,,,"Have you encountered authentication or credential failures before in RR loads? If yes, what was the outcome and resolution? Can this be recreated for validation?",Authentication failure will block the ingestion job. This may delay the pipeline and require credential rotation or manual fix.
Schema_Mismatches_001,New columns added in source,Add a column before load,New columns are ignored,Observed: New columns manually added in ODS due to no auto schema drift in test (metadata change control).,This will be handled in production during CDA process to enable automated schema drift.,"Can you confirm whether source schema changes can be tested? If this has happened before in prod, what resolution or process was followed?",New columns will not appear in ODS unless metadata is updated manually or schema drift is enabled. Could result in data loss or schema mismatch errors.
Schema_Mismatches_002,Expected columns are missing,Remove a column then load,Load fails; reset needed; columns loaded as NULL,"Observed: Workflow did not fail when 'Frozen' column was missing; ODS workflow proceeded, not matching expected behavior.",Needs alignment with expected failure behavior; review schema enforcement in ingestion layer.,"Can this missing column scenario be recreated safely in the test environment? If the issue occurred in the past, how was it handled? If not reproducible, is there an existing mitigation strategy?",ODS ingestion may proceed without errors but with NULLs or missing fields in critical reports. Could lead to silent data quality issues.
Schema_Mismatches_003,Data type mismatch,Amend data type before load,May fail or cast based on type,"Observed: Boolean/decimal conversion handled in code. Not tested: Day 1 decimal, Day 2 int type change.",Plan required to test day-wise type drift effect on pipeline.,"Can you validate if type mismatch scenarios are testable? If such issues occurred before, how were they managed? Any fallback logic or conversion in place?","Incorrect data formats may be ingested, leading to calculation errors or type casting exceptions in analytics layers."
Schema_Mismatches_004,Column order changed,Change order before load,No impact; process succeeds,,,"Have you encountered column reordering before? If yes, was there any ingestion issue and how was it addressed? Can this be tested?","No impact expected. The ingestion is column-position agnostic, so the data load should complete without issue."
System_001,Azure storage write failure,Simulate storage failure,Fails gracefully; alert raised,,,"Can a storage failure be safely triggered in test? If this has happened before, what was the observed behavior and recovery plan?","ODS write failure will interrupt the pipeline. No data will land in storage, triggering alerts and requiring rerun after fix."
System_002,Databricks cluster down mid-ingestion,Bring down cluster mid-run,Fails gracefully; alert raised,,,"Have you ever shut down the Databricks cluster mid-ingestion for testing? If yes, how did the pipeline respond and what recovery measures were applied?",Partial ingestion or job corruption possible. Downstream consumers may see incomplete data unless rollback or recovery is triggered.
System_003,Insufficient compute,Simulate low compute resources,Fails gracefully; alert raised,Workflow failed as expected.,,"Was compute throttling simulated? If so, what failure modes were observed and how were they addressed? If not testable, is a mitigation process in place?","Workflow failure likely. Ingestion job will not complete, and retry logic may kick in. Performance degradation expected."
System_004,Re-ingestion after failure,Retry after failure,Same batch loaded again correctly into Bronze,,,"Have you observed duplicate ingestion after a failure? If yes, what deduplication strategy or retry safeguard was implemented?","Duplicate or partial data ingestion could occur. If not de-duplicated properly, may lead to inflated reporting or alerts."

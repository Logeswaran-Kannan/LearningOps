Thanks, Saif and Pratik, for sharing the details — Graham and I were able to connect to the servers just fine.

However, Suraj and Mani, who are connecting from offshore via VPN, are still facing issues — even the jump server isn't working for them and they're getting an error. Would it be possible to redirect this to the right person who can look into it?

Also, I believe Pratik already flagged the issue with the jump server frequently disconnecting due to low storage — hopefully that's already on the radar.

Appreciate the support!

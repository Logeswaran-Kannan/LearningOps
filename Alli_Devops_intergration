üîß PostgreSQL Read Replica Connection Guide via Jump Server (mprd-jmp5032)
üßë‚Äçüíª Purpose
This document provides a step-by-step guide for users to connect to a PostgreSQL read replica database using pgAdmin 4, accessed through the internal jump server (mprd-jmp5032). This applies to connecting to databases like Billing Center (BC), Policy Center (PC), and Claim Center (CC).

üìç Pre-Requisites
Before starting, ensure you have:

Access to mprd-jmp5032 jump server (via your ADM credentials).

Your assigned PostgreSQL username and password (request from Project Manager / Test Lead / Dev Lead if not available).

The server host/IP address and port number (usually provided in project-specific communication).

Basic familiarity with using pgAdmin.

üöÄ Steps to Connect to PostgreSQL via pgAdmin 4
üîë Step 1: Log in to the Jump Server
Use Remote Desktop (RDP) to log in to the jump server:
Server Name: mprd-jmp5032
Credentials: Your ADM username and password

(e.g., via mstsc or corporate RDP access)

üß≠ Step 2: Launch pgAdmin 4
Once logged into the jump server, click Start or search for pgAdmin 4.

Open the application.

You‚Äôll be presented with the pgAdmin dashboard (screenshot below if available).

üìÅ Step 3: Register a New Server
In the Object Explorer (left-hand panel), right-click on Servers.

Click Register > Server.

A new pop-up window titled "Create - Server" will appear.

‚úçÔ∏è Step 4: Fill in Server Details
üîπ General Tab
Name: Enter a name for the connection.
Example:

For Billing Center: BC

For Policy Center: PC

For Claim Center: CC

This is just a label; it does not affect the actual connection.

üîπ Connection Tab
Provide the following:


Field	Value
Host name/address	e.g., azuk-insuranceplatform-dev-rdrep-1.czj8pblukekm.eu-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com (or internal IP like 10.4.48.179 if inside VPN)
Port	2000 (or as specified for your environment)
Maintenance database	Use the appropriate DB name (see below)
Username	Your PostgreSQL username (e.g., azuk_gwcpdev_std001_bc_ext)
Password	Password (request from PM/Test Lead/Dev Lead)
‚úÖ Save Password	Tick to save the password for future sessions
üìù Database Name Rule:
Remove _ext from the username to get the database name.
Example:

Username: azuk_gwcpdev_std001_bc_ext

Database: azuk_gwcpdev_std001_bc

üîÑ For PC or CC, simply replace bc with pc or cc in both the username and DB name.

üíæ Step 5: Save and Connect
Click Save.

pgAdmin will attempt to connect to the server.

If successful, the server will appear under Servers in the Object Explorer.

üß™ Step 6: Explore the Database
Expand the connected server ‚Üí Databases.

Click the appropriate database.

To run queries:

Right-click on the Database

Choose Query Tool

A SQL editor will open where you can run queries on tables.

üì∏ Screenshot References (if available)
Include sample screenshots for:

pgAdmin launch

Register server window

Connection tab filled in

Query tool interface

üîê Access Notes
If you receive connection timeout or "unable to connect" errors:

Ensure you're connected to the jump server (not over direct VPN).

Confirm port 2000 is open and the host/IP is reachable.

Contact infrastructure or DBA for assistance.

‚ùì Questions or Issues?
If you're unsure about:

The username/password

The exact host/IP

Or encounter connectivity errors

‚û°Ô∏è Please reach out to your Project Manager, Test Lead, or Dev Lead.

## Connecting to PostgreSQL Read Replica Database from Jump Server (mprd-jmp5032)

This document provides detailed steps on how to connect to the PostgreSQL Read Replica databases (e.g., Billing Center (BC), Policy Center (PC), and Claim Center (CC)) from the jump server **mprd-jmp5032** using the **pgAdmin 4** application.

### Prerequisites

- **Jump Server Access**: You must have your ADM username and password ready.
- **pgAdmin 4**: Installed and accessible on the jump server.
- **Database Passwords**: Obtain the necessary database passwords from your Project Manager, Test Lead, or Development Lead.

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Access Jump Server
- Use Remote Desktop Connection (RDP) to connect to the jump server **mprd-jmp5032** using your ADM credentials.

#### 2. Open pgAdmin 4 Application
- After logging into the jump server, locate the **pgAdmin 4** application from the Windows start menu or by typing "pgAdmin 4" in the search bar.
- Open the pgAdmin 4 application.

#### 3. Registering the PostgreSQL Server
- Upon launching pgAdmin 4, you'll see an **Object Explorer** pane on the left side of the screen.
- Within the Object Explorer, locate and expand the **Servers** menu.
- Right-click on **Servers** ‚Üí hover over **Register** ‚Üí click on **Server**.

#### 4. Configuring Server Connection
- A dialog box titled **Create - Server** will appear.

##### General Tab:
- In the **Name** field, enter the relevant server name. For example:
  - For Billing Center, enter: **BC**
  - For Policy Center, enter: **PC**
  - For Claim Center, enter: **CC**

##### Connection Tab:
- Switch to the **Connection** tab in the same dialog box.
- Enter the following connection details:
  - **Hostname/address**: Provide the PostgreSQL Read Replica server address as shared by your DBA/Project Manager.
  - **Port**: Usually set to **5432** unless specified otherwise.
  - **Maintenance database**: Typically the same as your database name (e.g., `bc`, `pc`, `cc`). Confirm this detail from your Project Lead.
  - **Username**: Provided username (e.g., `adm_bc_user`, `adm_pc_user`, or `adm_cc_user`).
  - **Password**: Obtain this securely from your Project Manager, Test Lead, or Development Lead.
- Check the **Save Password** checkbox to avoid repeated prompts for the password.

#### 5. Establishing the Connection
- Click **Save** at the bottom of the dialog box.
- Once saved, your new server entry will appear under the **Servers** menu in the Object Explorer pane.
- Expand your server entry to see available databases.

#### 6. Accessing Database Components
- Expand the specific database (e.g., BC, PC, CC) to view available tables, schemas, and other components.

#### 7. Querying the Database
- Right-click on your database and select **Query Tool** from the context menu.
- A query window will open, allowing you to write and execute SQL queries directly against the connected database.

### Notes
- For other database centers, replace the term **BC** with the appropriate center initials (**PC** or **CC**) and provide the corresponding passwords.
- If connection issues occur, verify server details, ports, credentials, and ensure network connectivity from the jump server.

### Support
- Contact your Project Manager or IT support team for further assistance with connection details or troubleshooting any issues.

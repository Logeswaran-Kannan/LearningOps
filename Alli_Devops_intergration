Thanks Saif and Pratik for sharing the details! Graham and I managed to connect to the servers successfully. However, Suraj and Mani, who are connecting from offshore via VPN, aren't able to connect—they're getting the following error.

Also, there's another issue regarding frequent jump server disconnects due to low storage space. I believe Pratik has already flagged this, so hopefully it’s on the radar.

Thanks again for the help!

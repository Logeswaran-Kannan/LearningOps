🔧 PostgreSQL Read Replica Connection Guide via Jump Server (mprd-jmp5032)
🧑‍💻 Purpose
This document provides a step-by-step guide for users to connect to a PostgreSQL read replica database using pgAdmin 4, accessed through the internal jump server (mprd-jmp5032). This applies to connecting to databases like Billing Center (BC), Policy Center (PC), and Claim Center (CC).

📍 Pre-Requisites
Before starting, ensure you have:

Access to mprd-jmp5032 jump server (via your ADM credentials).

Your assigned PostgreSQL username and password (request from Project Manager / Test Lead / Dev Lead if not available).

The server host/IP address and port number (usually provided in project-specific communication).

Basic familiarity with using pgAdmin.

🚀 Steps to Connect to PostgreSQL via pgAdmin 4
🔑 Step 1: Log in to the Jump Server
Use Remote Desktop (RDP) to log in to the jump server:
Server Name: mprd-jmp5032
Credentials: Your ADM username and password

(e.g., via mstsc or corporate RDP access)

🧭 Step 2: Launch pgAdmin 4
Once logged into the jump server, click Start or search for pgAdmin 4.

Open the application.

You’ll be presented with the pgAdmin dashboard (screenshot below if available).

📁 Step 3: Register a New Server
In the Object Explorer (left-hand panel), right-click on Servers.

Click Register > Server.

A new pop-up window titled "Create - Server" will appear.

✍️ Step 4: Fill in Server Details
🔹 General Tab
Name: Enter a name for the connection.
Example:

For Billing Center: BC

For Policy Center: PC

For Claim Center: CC

This is just a label; it does not affect the actual connection.

🔹 Connection Tab
Provide the following:


Field	Value
Host name/address	e.g., azuk-insuranceplatform-dev-rdrep-1.czj8pblukekm.eu-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com (or internal IP like 10.4.48.179 if inside VPN)
Port	2000 (or as specified for your environment)
Maintenance database	Use the appropriate DB name (see below)
Username	Your PostgreSQL username (e.g., azuk_gwcpdev_std001_bc_ext)
Password	Password (request from PM/Test Lead/Dev Lead)
✅ Save Password	Tick to save the password for future sessions
📝 Database Name Rule:
Remove _ext from the username to get the database name.
Example:

Username: azuk_gwcpdev_std001_bc_ext

Database: azuk_gwcpdev_std001_bc

🔄 For PC or CC, simply replace bc with pc or cc in both the username and DB name.

💾 Step 5: Save and Connect
Click Save.

pgAdmin will attempt to connect to the server.

If successful, the server will appear under Servers in the Object Explorer.

🧪 Step 6: Explore the Database
Expand the connected server → Databases.

Click the appropriate database.

To run queries:

Right-click on the Database

Choose Query Tool

A SQL editor will open where you can run queries on tables.

🔐 Access Notes
If you receive connection timeout or "unable to connect" errors:

Ensure you're connected to the jump server (not over direct VPN).

Confirm port 2000 is open and the host/IP is reachable.

Contact infrastructure or DBA for assistance.

❓ Questions or Issues?
If you're unsure about:

The username/password

The exact host/IP

Or encounter connectivity errors

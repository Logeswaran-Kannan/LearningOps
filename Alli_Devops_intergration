Hi Team,

Thanks for sharing the details earlier!

I was able to connect to the jump server successfully, and then tried accessing the read replica using pgAdmin 4 with the information I found in the email thread below. However, the connection isn’t going through, and some of the details seem a bit unclear.

Could someone please confirm if I’m using the correct approach to connect to the server? I’ve tried with the details below, but haven’t had any luck so far.

Thanks in advance for your help!

Best,
[Your Name]

I'm from the BICOE data team — just reaching out regarding the connection setup for the read replica DB using pgAdmin. Saif mentioned that you were able to get it working successfully, so thought I’d check in with you.

Would you mind walking us through how you managed to connect pgAdmin to the PostgreSQL read replica? Let me know when you're free — happy to jump on a quick call to discuss.

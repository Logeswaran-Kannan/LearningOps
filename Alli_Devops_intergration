Thanks for the info!

It looks like there isn’t any existing server connection set up for BC, at least from what I can see on my end — I’m not finding it in pgAdmin. Not sure if that’s the case for everyone or just me.

I was checking in the highlighted area where I expected the connection details to be listed, but it seems to be blank at the moment. Totally possible I’m looking in the wrong place — happy to be pointed in the right direction if so!

Appreciate your help!

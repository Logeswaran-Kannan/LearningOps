I’m still connected to the jump server at the moment, but some folks on the team aren’t able to get in via remote connection. Even on my end, I’m seeing frequent disconnects — looks like it could be a storage issue. Might be worth flagging if it's due to low space or maybe the server's hitting a limit on how many users it can handle at once.

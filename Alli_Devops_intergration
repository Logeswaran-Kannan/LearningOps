I finally managed to connect to PC and BC from pgAdmin. Looks like the server names in the emails were a bit outdated — had to update with the latest details to get it working.

One issue though: the jump server keeps disconnecting frequently, seems like it might be running into some space problems. PC and BC connections are fine now, I can see the tables — just about to check CC next.

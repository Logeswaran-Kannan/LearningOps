Also, just to flag — a few of us on the team are having trouble connecting to the remote server, regardless of location. I’m also noticing frequent disconnects from the jump server, which might be due to low storage or maybe it’s limiting the number of active users.

Not sure if that’s the root cause, but thought I’d call it out in case it’s not already on the radar.

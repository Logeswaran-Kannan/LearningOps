Hello Sarah,

I trust you're doing well. Just a quick heads-up that the test version of the B2A report, following our recent production release, is now ready for your examination. Please note that concurrent sanity testing is currently underway. In the meantime, it would be greatly appreciated if your team could take a high-level glance at the report and share your feedback or highlight any concerns that may require attention. Your insights are of significant value.

You can access the B2A test version report through the link provided below. If everything appears to be in good order and aligns with our requirements, this version of the report will take the place of the current production one.

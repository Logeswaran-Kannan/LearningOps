Amber, could you please have a conversation with Jeelani and Akshay to understand the challenges they might be facing in fulfilling their responsibilities? I've noticed a significant number of defect leakages, a reluctance to speak up during calls, and hesitation in taking on responsibilities. While they excel on the technical front, that alone isn't sufficient for effective team collaboration.

Despite validating the same data for multiple releases, there hasn't been an apparent improvement in their understanding of the business aspects. Their hesitancy to step up has resulted in me having to review their work regularly, which hampers overall team productivity. I'm uncertain if this issue stems from the Work From Office (WFO) situation or personal reasons, but I've observed that Akshay isn't available during the committed hours.

I've already reached out to them through multiple emails and discussions. You might be aware of these ongoing communications, as I've kept you informed. Due to my responsibilities, I'm constantly engaged in back-to-back meetings, making it impossible for me to review their work considering their level of experience.

It's essential for them to step up; otherwise, having two offshore resources becomes counterproductive. I've been questioned about the 1:3 developer to tester ratio on the billing front by the Project Manager. Designers are actively involved in testing and finding defects, which highlights the need for Jeelani and Akshay to recognize the situation and be willing to enhance their skills and responsibilities. Your assistance in addressing this matter is greatly appreciated.

So, we're facing a bit of a challenge in preprod â€“ our data isn't as clean as we need it to be. Both our bespoke and base schemas aren't showing the complete data set like they do in production. Here's what we've brainstormed so far:

Option 1: We could merge both bronze data sources into one, calling it Aurora bronze, and then process it into the analytical layer. It might take a few days to process, and even then, we're not entirely sure if it'll cover everything we need. We should cross-verify this against production.

Option 2: Another idea is to request a full refresh from CDL and run a clean setup in preprod with a single, true schema. This sounds ideal and would definitely reduce data sync-up problems. But, it would impact our production release and might take a few days to complete.

Option 3: Alternatively, we could copy the current production bronze data into preprod and set up a clean run using the base schema. This should reduce the missing data issue, although we're not entirely certain if copying data from production to preprod is the best approach.

Option 4: Given that preprod isn't the most stable right now, we might consider continuing our testing in the test environment. We can validate with minimal test data, but report testing will be impacted since it won't have all the agent details we see in production.

All these options have their pros and cons. We're on a tight schedule, so we really need to figure out the best way forward. If you guys have any other ideas, please feel free to pitch in. Let's work together to find the most practical solution.

Subject: Tomorrow's Priority Tasks and Clarification

Hello Team,

I wanted to outline our priorities for tomorrow:

UAT Observations in Production:
Please collaborate with the run team during offshore hours to check UAT observations in the production environment. Provide your signoff on the production sanity check and thoroughly document the test results. The run team will be available to assist you.

Panel Change Release:
I've handed over the test scripts, and defect refinement is complete. Sungjin will be available during offshore hours. Please verify the changes based on the reload.

Open Defects on Aurora:
Review all open defects on Aurora with the support of the run team in production. Update the status of these defects accordingly. There are no dependencies in this task.

Test Design for Extract to Panel and GIPP Design Delivered Tables:
Begin the test design process for the Extract to Panel and GIPP design delivered tables.

Additionally, I want to assure you that your concerns, as discussed with me, will be thoroughly addressed. Following my conversation today with Amber and Sujatha, necessary actions will be taken.

Feel free to reach out if you need further clarification or assistance with anything.

Best regards,
[Your Position]

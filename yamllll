Amber, thank you for the update. Somehow, your email ended up in my secondary folder. For this week, I anticipate the presence and availability of our core resources to take responsibility for production checkout. There may also be a need for Nishant's assistance with some analysis tasks for the next immediate release. Our project is currently in a critical phase due to open business incidents, and the project team is taking on additional responsibilities to keep production running smoothly. In light of this, I expect the testing team to step up and fulfill their commitments and responsibilities.

Jeelani and Akshay, please proactively plan your tasks and share any details you require from me. I'll be engaged in B2B calls related to production incidents, so feel free to reach out if you need anything to expedite TSR production, ideally by tomorrow, as discussed.

Regarding our specific projects:

Aurora: I've been informed that the only pending items are related to defect fixes and report validation. I've already discussed this with the project team. As decided, the fixes will go into the test environment first, followed by pre-production. Our designers and architects are on standby to support any defect identification during revalidation. The data load in the test environment will be ready by the end of today, and we have the full day tomorrow to check all the defects necessary for B2A reports. Let's aim to produce TSR by tomorrow's close of play. Please highlight any potential risks you foresee for the Thursday release. Since we've invested a substantial amount of time in TS02, please ensure all scripts are ready for a production sanity check.

Panel Change: Testing has been completed for all delivered tables, and the scripts have been handed over to Nishant for further data analysis. The release is planned for the 10th of October. Please plan your tasks accordingly.

Thank you for your cooperation and diligence in these critical efforts.

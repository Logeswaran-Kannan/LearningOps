Due to limitations in the pre-production environment not being correctly synchronized with the production data and an issue with the checkpoint, we were unable to perform the reconciliation. Following discussions with the data owner, Jason, this situation is acknowledged as a risk to quality assurance. It has been decided to carry this risk into production, especially considering the existing impact on the B2A report flow due to the previous release. Post-release, this reconciliation will be conducted by business users in collaboration with the SIT testing team. The acceptance of this risk is based on the understanding that any deviation exceeding 5% will be treated as a significant risk, requiring an immediate fix.

Upon revalidation, it was discovered that most of the columns have been fixed. However, a code fix for a column named "TENURE UNDERWRITER" was found to be missing, as indicated in the comment below. Consequently, the severity has been downgraded to S2.

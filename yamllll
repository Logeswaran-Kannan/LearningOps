I'd like to provide you with the test URL link for the B2A report, which includes data from both STRATA and TIARA for both Motor and Home. Please be aware that there are currently open issues that the development team is actively addressing.

For the time being, if you could take a high-level look at the report with a focus on its overall appearance and initial data quality, we would greatly appreciate your input. If you identify any areas where modifications may be necessary, please don't hesitate to let us know.

The data in this report spans from January 2023 up to yesterday's date. We anticipate that once the development team resolves the open issues, the data quality will significantly improve.

Your insights and feedback are invaluable as we work to enhance this report. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

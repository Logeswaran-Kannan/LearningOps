Here's a rephrased version of the testing risks you've identified during validation:

Source Data Issues Excluded from Testing Scope (Risk #1): In Release 1 of TS02, we've excluded all source data issues from our testing scope. This decision is based on the fact that the timeline for resolving these issues falls outside the control of the DAVE 2.0 project. All open defects have been categorized as source data issues. Consequently, numerous known source data issues have impacted the granularity of the silver tables, making it impossible for us to verify them fully. This may necessitate code changes either retrospectively or in a subsequent release planned after this one.

Limited Validation Period Due to High Message Volume (Risk #2): We faced constraints in the validation period due to a substantial incoming message volume. As per the recommendation of the development team, we restricted the validation to data from July 1st onwards. However, out of the 141 tables, 33 have insufficient data for validation. We focused our efforts on validating only the priority-listed tables provided by the designer. This decision reduced test coverage, aligning with risk-based testing principles, and was accepted by the project team.

Resource and Memory Limitations in Lower Environments (Risk #3): In lower testing environments, resource constraints and low memory configurations hindered our ability to perform full-level orchestration validation, similar to what is expected in production. This issue persisted in the preprod environment as well. Nevertheless, the development team expressed confidence that this issue would not occur in production due to the greater capacity there.

Data Missing in Silver Layer (Risk #4): During testing in the lower test environment, we observed data discrepancies in the silver layer's final table. This was attributed to a delay in data synchronization between driver and non-driver tables in CDL. The issue was resolved in DAVE preprod by adjusting the time gap between these tables. Currently, in the preprod environment with less data, this issue is not manifesting; however, there is a high likelihood it may occur in production.

Historical Data Fix for UTC Issue (Risk #5): We couldn't conduct testing for the historical data fix related to the UTC issue in the preprod environment due to resource and memory constraints. No historical data was loaded to test this. Nevertheless, this fix remains a crucial task to be executed during the production release.

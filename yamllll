Hello Sarah,

Just a quick note to let you know that the post-release test version of the B2A report, which pulls data from the live DAVE 2 environment, is ready for your review. Please note that there is ongoing sanity testing taking place simultaneously. In the meantime, I'd appreciate it if your team could take a high-level look at the report and share any feedback or highlight any issues that need addressing. Your insights are incredibly valuable to us.

Here's the link to access the B2A test version: [Insert Link]

If everything checks out and meets our requirements, this version of the report will replace the current production one.

Thanks in advance for your time and attention.

Best regards, [Your Name]

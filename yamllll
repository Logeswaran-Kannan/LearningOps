I've asked for some extra testing help from another project, and they currently have the bandwidth to support us. The best part is, they won't charge it to the Aurora project. Prijo and Nishant are onboard to assist with UAT. Prijo's got experience with B2A, so I believe it'll lighten our workload. Hope that works for you

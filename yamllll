Source Data Issues Excluded: Source data issues, categorized as open defects, are excluded from TS02 Release 1 testing due to their resolution timeline being beyond project control. Known source data issues have impacted silver table granularity, potentially requiring post-release code changes.

Limited Validation Period: Validation restricted to data from July 1st due to a high message volume. Of the 141 tables, 33 lack data for validation. Priority-listed tables were validated, reducing test coverage in favor of risk-based testing per project team acceptance.

Resource Constraints in Lower Environments: Lower environment's resource and memory limitations prevented full orchestration validation. Although this issue persisted in preprod, the development team is confident it won't occur in production with greater capacity.

Data Missing in Silver Layer: Data gaps observed in the lower test environment's silver layer final table due to CDL data lag, resolved in DAVE preprod by adjusting driver and non-driver table synchronization. While not occurring in the current preprod with less data, the risk remains for production.

Historical Data UTC Fix: Historical data UTC fix not tested in preprod due to resource and memory constraints. This critical task is slated for execution during the production release.

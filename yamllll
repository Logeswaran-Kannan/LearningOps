Subject: Key Outstanding Items Required for SIT Closure

Hi there,

To move forward and bring System Integration Testing (SIT) to a successful close, we have a few essential items that need your attention. Currently, these aspects must be addressed to keep the SIT process on track:

LLD Update: We require an updated Low-Level Design (LLD) reflecting the latest code version. It's crucial to ensure that our testing practices are aligned correctly, as depending on the development code base for our test SQL is not ideal and could result in potential defects leaking into the production environment. An updated LLD is essential to continue our test execution.

Open Report Issues: Several open issues in the reports are causing calculation changes. These need to be resolved to maintain the accuracy and reliability of our reports.

Open Defects in Source Data and Code: There are open defects in both source data and code that require your attention. Addressing these defects is vital for the overall integrity of the system.

Orchestration and Incremental Load: The orchestration and incremental load processes need to be reviewed and addressed. Ensuring their proper functioning is essential to move the report to the User Acceptance Testing (UAT) phase and ensure TSR readiness.

Addressing these outstanding items is crucial for the smooth progression of our testing process and the eventual transition to the UAT phase. Your prompt attention to these matters is greatly appreciated.

Best regards,

[Your Name]

Thanks, Akshay,

I've already raised the LLD concern with Mitul, and hopefully, it'll be addressed by tomorrow. For now, please continue using the development code.

As for tomorrow's priorities, focus on fact and report testing (I've briefed Jeelani on the observations). Jeelani will concentrate on incremental changes and should have the cost analysis ready. If neither of these is ready, start looking into the validation of the insurance scheme aggregation tables.

Best regards,

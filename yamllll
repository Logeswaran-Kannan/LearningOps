Following the defect triage on September 25th, it has been categorized as a source data issue. This specific table serves as one of the sources for the B2A report. However, the designer has currently confirmed that the data received from this table pertains to cross sales. Importantly, there is currently no cross sales activity occurring in Echelon, even in the production environment. Consequently, in alignment with the consensus, the impact on the B2A report is considered of low severity at this time. However, it's worth noting that this issue may have potential implications at a later stage.

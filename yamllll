I've asked for some extra testing help from another project, and they currently have the bandwidth to support us. The best part is, they won't charge it to the Aurora project. Prijo and Nishant are onboard to assist with UAT. Prijo's got experience with B2A, so I believe it'll lighten our workload. Hope that works for you


Jeelani, I've noticed that some of the updates I specifically requested are missing from the status report. Could we make the test execution details more specific, rather than providing a very high-level overview? Specifically, I'd like to see:

"Jeelani, I haven't seen the updates I specifically requested in the status report. Can we make the test execution details more specific? Here's what I'm looking for:

Provide the overall test execution completion percentage for each entity; there's no need to split it between functional and business scenarios.
Ensure that the defect count matches the actual numbers.
Confirm if the percentage of remaining tasks accurately reflects defect severity.
Highlight any risks and dependencies that occurred during test execution.
Share the estimated time required to complete the remaining unexecuted tasks.
Can you provide a day-wise plan until release, including effort from supporting team members?
Consider taking charge of the UAT Execution Tracker for Signoff alongside Nishant or Sutapa, as you're officially assigned under Aurora.
Plan a sanity check for the Production release and schedule a review with Mitul on Monday.
Arrange for a walkthrough of Business Scenario test execution with the design team for signoff before release.
Ensure TSR readiness on Wednesday and inform me if any blockers arise that need prioritization.
Please review the status every day from Monday until the release to keep me updated.
Having these details will significantly help with our coordination with the Project Manager."

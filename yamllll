After the fix, revalidation showed a reduction in impact from 37 to 9 columns. The designer is further investigating these remaining 8 columns.

We are waiting for a fix in the lower environment due to missing data in preprod. Once the lower environment is fixed, we can validate in the test environment.

None of the schemas in preprod contain a complete dataset like in production due to a checkpoint issue, posing a blocker for testing in preprod. Data cleanup is required.

This issue was raised during report validation, indicating problems in Addon-related KPIs due to other open issues in underlying fact tables.

This ticket pertains to workflow failures in the lower environment. We've managed to verify E2E runs, but challenges like low resource constraints and workflow failures are impacting our cost analysis.

These defects are categorized as data missing issues related to DCD-45306.

We are awaiting deployment for resolution.

A discussion with the designer revealed a sample mismatch between DAVE1 and DAVE2. Investigation is ongoing.

There is a data load issue between silver and gold. We are awaiting deployment for resolution.

Revalidation is in progress at the source level, but it's also impacted by DCD-45306.

We are currently waiting for deployments and continuing our investigations to resolve these issues promptly.

I hope you're all well. As we're progressing with our Automation Validation using the SIT framework, I'd like to gather your valuable insights. Could you please provide a list of any changes, enhancements, pain points, or issues you've encountered during the process?

Our recent conversation with Simon revealed that he's willing to support us in streamlining our automation testing if we have specific requirements.

Kindly share your input before EOD today, so that I can consolidate the information and discuss it with Simon.

For example, a common challenge we're facing is token expiry impacting the pipeline's results capture in DevOps.

Your cooperation is highly appreciated.

ne disadvantage of restricting CD pipeline to only trigger from the main branch instead of feature branches is that it may lead to delays in the testing process. If a feature is developed on a feature branch and needs to be tested before merging into the main branch, the testing team will have to wait until the feature is merged before they can test it. This can slow down the overall development process and may cause delays in the release of the software.

Additionally, if the testing team identifies issues with the code during testing, they may need to wait for the code to be fixed on the main branch before they can continue with their testing. This can create a bottleneck in the testing process and lead to further delays.

Another disadvantage is that it can lead to lower quality code being merged into the main branch. Without testing on feature branches, there may be issues with the code that are not identified until after it has been merged into the main branch. This can cause more significant issues with the software and require more significant fixes than if the issues had been identified earlier in the development process.

Overall, while restricting CD pipeline to only trigger from the main branch may have some benefits, such as ensuring that code is tested before release, it can also lead to delays and lower code quality. It is important to strike a balance between the benefits and drawbacks of this approach and consider the needs of the development team as a whole.

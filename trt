Thank you for the update. I'm sorry to hear that Jeelani is going through a challenging personal situation. I hope he's receiving the necessary support. Please keep us informed about any assistance he may require.

Furthermore, I understand that he will be on parental leave for the next two weeks. Given the upcoming Aurora release and workload demands, we'll need alternative resources to manage Jeelani's responsibilities and efforts. Kindly provide information regarding the replacement resource.

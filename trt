I lead the testing for DATA & MI DAVE 2.0, supporting Aurora TS02 release tasks. We've identified certain defects categorized as source data issues, likely requiring resolution from CDL / Kingfisher. Could you confirm if you faced similar issues during your SIT phase? If so, kindly share relevant defect specifics and the expected fix timeline. Alternatively, could you prioritize this fix, given it's obstructing our release? Feel free to ask for additional details if needed.

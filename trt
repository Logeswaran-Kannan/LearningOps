I hope this message finds you well. I'd like to share the list of defects directly associated with Release 1. It's important that we focus our attention on resolving these issues for today's deployment. Our discussions during today's defects triage session have shed light on some important considerations.

Vinod brought up an important point regarding defects tied to source data. We need to delve into the potential impact these might have on production if they remain unresolved before our release date. The fact that these issues are affecting our analytical layer and the upcoming panel extract release adds to their significance. We should engage in a thorough discussion around these source data-related defects.

I'd like to emphasize that until we address and resolve these defects, we won't be able to proceed with pre-production activities. The timeline for fixing these issues, retesting, and ensuring everything is in place before the 25th is indeed tight. This even includes the pre-production validation, which is an added challenge.

I encourage Ben and Vinod to share their insights and perspectives on this matter, as their input is vital to our course of action.

Effectively designed a Databricks-based automated regression framework for the analytical layer, enabling the team to conduct multiple cycles of regression testing in significantly less time. This initiative resulted in the identification of over 160 defects and substantial time savings. The framework was developed with reusability in mind across all domain lines. Successfully trained all team members to efficiently utilize this tool, leading to time savings by reducing the validation time for projects with extensive data volumes. Additionally, the framework proved instrumental in validating data from diverse sources such as databases, streaming platforms, and files.

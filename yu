Modifications are needed in the VC Claims mart to encompass data from all source systems. Samples generated from claim application sources such as Synergy and ICE are absent in the ultimate mart table.

Following discussions with the developer, there is a plan to engage with the designer to amend the Low-Level Design (LLD) and implement the necessary changes in both the table and dataset.

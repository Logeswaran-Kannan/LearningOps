After discussing with Deepakkumar Sing, it appears that no communication or notification was sent to me before the start of this cleanup activity. If there was, I request him to attach the notification email to the incident. I believe it's ideal to receive prior notifications and information about activities that will impact me before any changes take place. As suggested by Deepakkumar, I recommend assigning this incident to Veneet Joshi for escalation. Additionally, it seems that only high-level guidance has been provided on files being backed up on OneDrive, with no information about custom applications installed and their configured settings.

To continue my work without impacting project timelines and deliverables, I require local admin access to redo all these configurations. Can you please arrange local admin access for me? In the future, to avoid such situations, I expect clear communication and notifications to be sent to end users who will be impacted by any change. It's essential to get their confirmation and address any challenges before applying changes to their work environment, preventing unnecessary reworks.

Designed and implemented a Databricks-based automated regression framework for the analytical layer, enabling multiple cycles of testing in less time. Identified 160+ defects and achieved significant time savings. The reusable framework spans all domain lines. Trained team members to use the tool effectively, reducing validation time for projects with extensive data and enabling validation across databases, streaming sources, and files.

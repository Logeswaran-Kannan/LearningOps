Problem Statement:

This Hot Fix addresses a Business change request for the existing AIP - Pricing Remedy Tenure Report. The business expects to see POS APR instead of APR derived from DAVE.
Reason for Change:

The derived APR is displaying values greater than 50%, which do not accurately reflect the actual APR associated with the policy. Therefore, the decision was made to replace the APR derived from DAVE with the actual POS APR received from CDL in the AIP - Pricing Remedy Tenure Report.
Solution Approach:

To address the problem statement, it was decided to modify the design to accommodate the changes. For the History fix, a manual merge will be performed to update the key.
Validation Approach:

As part of this hot fix validation, the project team agreed to test only at the FACT level. The changes to the report, which involve replacing APR with POS_APR in the dataset, were not done in the lower environment as the report changes will be directly implemented in production. This is considered a Medium risk.
Data Anomalies:

In the lower environment, we observed very few samples with unrealistic POS APR, categorized as a source data issue. Similarly, in production, we observed POS APR as 40, which requires further investigation by the business, as DAVE consumes the data as is from CDL.
Exemptions:

Cost analysis and Preprod testing are exempt for this hot fix release.

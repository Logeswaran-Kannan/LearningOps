Subject: Request for Year-End Discussion

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. My name is [Your Name], and I have recently been tagged to you as my previous Home manager, Mitchell Ian, has undergone a change.

I would like to take this opportunity to introduce myself and express my interest in discussing the Year-End Assessment (YEA). Given the recent changes, I believe it would be beneficial for us to connect and discuss any upcoming plans and expectations.

Could you please let me know a time that would be convenient for you to have this discussion? I am eager to get acquainted and ensure a smooth transition in our collaboration.

Thank you, and I look forward to your response.

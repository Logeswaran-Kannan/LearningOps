In our current production environment, we are unable to separate the cost details specific to gold quote tables in Databricks. The tags used to identify them include both silver and gold quotes, resulting in a combined and excessively high cost in production. I don't consider this suitable as the initial cost. I believe Sungjin's work should not have any dependency on this. During the morning call, you mentioned that at the DLT level, we can view these cost details. Could you please provide guidance on how we can access that specific detail?

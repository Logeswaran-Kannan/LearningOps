The policies that were reported as missing for Tom Richardson have been verified, and they are indeed present in the fact table. They are also accurately reflected in the reporting SQL, aligning with the date specified by the user, except for one policy, which is policy number 812. There is no action required by the DAVE 2 team regarding this matter.

The next action item is to coordinate with the run team to explain this situation to the business user. For the specific policy where the date is not aligned, it may be advisable to cross-check the exact transaction date in the front-end system. Currently, DAVE is displaying the value it receives directly from the source for this particular policy.

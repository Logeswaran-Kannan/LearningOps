ello Team,

Regarding the scenarios discussed this morning concerning the missing prov code for New Business transactions, I conducted some investigation before raising a CDL incident. It appears that the RTPLOG_IDs, which were missing in MV_RISKDETAIL, are present in the RTPLOGXX table with valid prov codes assigned to them. It seems there might be an issue on our end. I have provided a sample below for reference.

In another scenario related to GIPP pricing remedy, we discussed situations where the payment method changes from installment to PayInFull between NB CONF and MTA CONF transactions. We observed that this scenario occurs in production as well. It appears to be a valid scenario in the production environment. Please advise on how to handle this situation.

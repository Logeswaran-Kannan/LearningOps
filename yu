I am unable to access my VDI (azwe-vdi-pool-3). Instead, it's connecting to a new fresh VDI. I am currently in the middle of a project release where I have all my tools configured and automation scripts set up in my previous VDI. I require my previous version as this situation is affecting my deliverables. Please assist me with this matter.

Our testing begins solely with data streamed from Kingfisher to Event Hub and ingested into DAVE Azure Data Lake to ensure we receive all the data CDL sends to DAVE for MI and Analytics purposes. Currently, we consume data from Event Hub through an ad-hoc batch process, but it will transition to a scheduled batch process in the future. We primarily reuse existing data in the environment and create test data only for rare, specific business scenarios. We utilize the CDL front end solely for read-only reference to check end-to-end validation and are not involved in any data creation.

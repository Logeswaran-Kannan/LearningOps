Hello Sarah!

As you pointed out, there has been a change related to the operator ID from the Echelon side. The issue with the missing sales in the B2A report for these two agents has been resolved, and they are now appearing in the report.

The fix was applied at the CDL end because their operator IDs were incorrectly mapped in the CDL system. This issue has been rectified. However, the changes that took place in November at the CDL end mean that sales made by these agents before that date are now categorized under a different reporting date. The system treats these changes as new business events for the respective policies, as the fix was implemented at the source side.

The good news is that they can now see the accurate sales count from November onwards. Any sales they made before this date will be considered in October sales to ensure that we capture all their sales prior to the fix applied in November from CDL.

I hope this clarifies the behavior of the sales data before November 5th.

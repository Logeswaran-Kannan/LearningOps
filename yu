I trust that the following updates have been completed. Could you please verify?

Initial and incremental SCD data loads.
Risk profile key '224' is missing in the dimension table.
The logic for risk profile key '-300' has been updated with the latest code.
There has been a logic change for the quote type key for the policy.
Thank you.

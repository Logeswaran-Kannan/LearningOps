As a BlueBolt CII champion, I successfully led the team into the BlueBolt program, converting the idea into significant savings for both the client and Cognizant. Acknowledged by the client platform architecture team for presenting the BlueBolt concept, it inspired them to establish a similar program for their in-house team. This initiative resulted in substantial soft and hard dollar savings, enhancing team productivity through automated tools.

The implemented functionality for the E2P fix has undergone verification with the business, and changes have been made based on their suggestions. We appreciate all your support. Additionally, suggestions have been received to conduct detailed smoke testing to ensure data quality, as the data in preprod does not support verification of all business cases. Based on the condition signoff received, we are scheduled to release on March 5th.

The policies provided by the user were inaccurately linked to a different operator with a similar name in the CDL. No action is needed from DAVE 2 in this regard. The problem has been resolved by the CDL team, and we have confirmed that it now appears correctly in the analytical layer for the incremental data. However, a historical data fix is required for the data in the silver and gold layers to ensure it is accurately reflected in the report. The next action item is for the run team to address this historical data issue.

Summary of this week's activities:

Milestone 1, which concentrated on the release of Analytical Layer non-migrated policies in preprod, included the following achievements:

During the week, we conducted retesting and subsequently closed four analytical issues pertaining to RTP_RISKDETAIL and RTP_SCHEMADATALIST.

Defects related to source data were identified and raised in the AUR board for end-to-end triage.

Progress was made on regression table validation for both CORE and SI, with 65% coverage completed.

Furthermore, we are in the process of retesting the silver defects that have been reassigned to the testing team.

Following my discussion with Deepakkumar Sing, it appears that no communication or notification has been sent to end users before the initiation of this cleanup activity. I believe it is essential to provide prior notifications and information to end users who will be affected by this change. Ideally, a notification should have been sent before implementing this change. Additionally, it seems that only high-level guidance has been provided regarding files being backed up on OneDrive, with no information about custom applications installed and settings configured for them.

To proceed with my work, I require local admin access to redo all these configurations in alignment with project timelines and deliverables. Could you please arrange local admin access for me? In the future, to prevent such situations, I suggest clear communication and notifications to be sent to end users who will be impacted by any change. It's crucial to obtain their confirmation and address any challenges before applying changes to their work environment, thus avoiding unnecessary reworks.

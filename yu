Hey Team,

Just a quick update - we've calculated the estimated preprod cost for the Panel Change release following our discussion over the call. We generated two estimates based on the data-ready UAT option. Since this cost is derived from our current production expenses, it should ideally closely mirror the actual estimated cost.

However, we'll be closely monitoring this during our first load in preprod on day 1. If it surpasses 50% of the estimated cost, we'll pause and discuss additional steps to refine our estimation with more parameters.

Best,
[Your Name]

Please review the summary outcome of the high-level sanity check:

The historical data was processed from landing to the outbound file area where the sagacity team can access files for further processing. However, we were unable to view the outbound file generated, possibly because the sagacity team processed it from the outbound path, and the file got deleted. To confirm, we need clarification from the sagacity team. Oona will follow up on this matter.

The initial load file count has been verified with Kevin, and we received confirmation that it matches the expected file count.

Although the incremental job load is complete, no incremental data has been processed. Oona will follow up with Julian to enable the automated process for the daily feed to the landing area.

For business user notification, we require a list of business/interested users for day-to-day job status notifications. Oona will provide that list.

A high-level duplicates check was performed on each analytical layer table. Apart from known observations, no new duplicates were found.

Thanks to Pavan for providing support in conducting the sanity check validation in the production area.

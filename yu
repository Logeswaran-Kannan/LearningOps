Summary for this week:

The functionality for the E2P fix has been successfully implemented and verified with the business. Changes were made based on their suggestions. However, we have received feedback to conduct detailed smoke testing to ensure data quality, as the data in preprod does not support verification of all business cases. Based on the condition signoff received, we are scheduled to release on March 5th.

The Deployment Plan and TSR have been handed over to the Run Team as part of the Release readiness process.

Cost analysis on preprod is complete, and we have utilized only 25% of the planned cost.

We are currently awaiting CAB approval for the release.

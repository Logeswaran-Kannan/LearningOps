Risk for Item 2:

The cloud cost estimation may not align with the budgetary constraints or expectations of the cloud council, leading to delays or reevaluation of the project's financial feasibility.
If the cloud council does not approve the estimated costs, it may result in a halt or delay in moving the code to the preprod environment, impacting the project timeline and delivery.
Risk for Item 3:

The discrepancy in test data availability between preprod and production environments may lead to inaccurate testing results and incomplete validation.
If the deviation analysis and calibration process do not effectively align the test data with production, it may impact the accuracy and reliability of the UAT testing results.
Failure to address the data discrepancy could result in delayed UAT, prolonging the overall testing phase and potentially delaying the project delivery.

Rephrase - 1. There is source data missing issue in MV_POLICY and MV_POLICY_HISTORY leads to RTPLOG_ID and Webreference is making unable to check E2P fix fully as this scenqrio is failing , as there is known source data sync up issue in test environment its been decided to test this scenqrio in preprod.  2. As the agent key present in  test data in test users and will not have hit in dim employee table so we unable to verify the agent details as is like production As there is known data sync up issue whenever new schema gets create in test environment we unable to verify other key columns ,  so its been decice to verify the fix at preprod level

The absence of source data in MV_POLICY and MV_POLICY_HISTORY, leading to missing RTPLOG_ID and Webreference, has hindered the complete validation of the E2P fix. Due to a recognized source data synchronization issue in the test environment, it has been determined that testing this scenario in preprod is necessary.

The presence of the agent key in test data within test users, without a corresponding entry in the dim employee table, hampers the verification of agent details in line with production. Given the acknowledged data synchronization issue whenever a new schema is created in the test environment, validating other key columns becomes challenging. Consequently, it has been decided to assess the fix at the preprod level.

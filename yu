Given the transition, I believe it would be beneficial for us to connect and talk about the upcoming year-end activities.

Could you please share your availability for a discussion at your earliest convenience? I am flexible and can adjust to a time that suits you.

I look forward to our conversation and appreciate your time in advance.

Subject: Preprod Computing Cost Overview for Initial Load

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I trust this message finds you well. I wanted to share the details of the computing costs incurred in our preprod environment during the processing of the initial 4-week data load in the silver and gold layers for both quote and policy.

The provided cost comparison is based on preprod data processed against production one-day data for reference. It's important to note that this comparison serves as informational at this stage. The actual comparison, considering incremental loads in preprod, is scheduled for Monday. This will allow us to assess and compare one-day costs between production and preprod more accurately.

Please be aware that, currently, silver and gold quotes are not running in production. To address this, we have estimated Â£9 based on the cost incurred during the initial load in production. Unfortunately, we are unable to provide precise incurred costs for silver and gold quotes due to the mentioned reason. Additionally, storage costs cannot be determined as we lack project-wise segregation in the production environment.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. If you have any questions or require further clarification, please feel free to reach out.

Observation 1: In the test environment, there are instances where both the Webreference and policy reference fields populate as 0 for certain samples. Our primary focus is to verify the quote_ind column, which is undergoing logic changes as part of the E2P fix. Therefore, it has been determined that validating this scenario in production is necessary.

We have observed a similar scenario in production, where the absence of a business event ID between the mv_policy and mv_policy_event_history tables results in missing Webreference and policy reference values. Based on our initial observations, this issue appears to have started occurring around February 14th, 2024.

Given that the issue already exists in production, it should be treated as a production incident rather than a defect.

We've completed a high-level data validation for six columns newly added to four existing entities. Our assumption was that these six columns will only receive forward-looking data, and for historical data, they will be null. However, we observed one discrepancy in the Quotedetail entity concerning the datatype of column 'aax_labouvat.' In the email chain below, it was mentioned as 'decimal (38,2),' but in the actual Data Definition Language (DDL), it's defined as 'double.' From a data perspective, this doesn't make a difference as the source sends it with two precision. However, it's important to note that there is a difference between decimal with precision and double. We want to confirm if this difference is acceptable.

For regression testing, we conducted high-level data validation with the previously benchmarked data, and everything looks good.

In summary, if you need exact precision and have a specific number of digits before and after the decimal point, you might prefer DECIMAL. If you can tolerate some level of approximation and need a wider range of values, you might opt for DOUBLE. The choice depends on the specific requirements of your use case, particularly regarding precision and range.

Quick Intermediate Status Update:

Issue DCD-47490:

In the test environment, Webreference and policy reference are populating as 0 for some samples.
We are primarily investigating this scenario to validate the 'quote_ind' column, which is undergoing logic changes as part of the E2P fix.
It has been decided to validate this scenario in production, where we have observed the same issue.
The issue stems from missing business event IDs between 'mv_policy' and 'mv_policy_event_history' in production, which are the sources for Webreference and policy reference.
Initial observations suggest that this issue started occurring from Feb 14th, 2024.
Given that the issue already exists in production, it should be considered a production incident rather than a defect.
Observation - Duplicates in Risk Profile Master Table:

Three risk profile category key columns have duplicates in the risk profile master table.
A hotfix has been applied in production, and Sungjin will implement the changes in preprod as well.
Data load is currently in progress and will be completed within an hour.
Issue DCD-47477 - Agent Key:

The issue of the agent key populating as -1 also exists in the preprod environment.
We are conducting an analysis against production to identify any deviations.

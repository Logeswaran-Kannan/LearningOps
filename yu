We just wrapped up a Show and Tell session with our UAT users, and here's what we covered:

We conducted a thorough walkthrough of the open defects, and as a result, we managed to close two of them successfully. Great progress!

There are two remaining defects that UAT users will look into with their team. These relate to the previous month's date slider and color coding. We're confident they'll provide valuable input.

We made it clear that the data in the UAT environment is for testing purposes only and doesn't represent real live scenarios. Additionally, there's no Preprod data available for them to test.

Overall, it was a productive session, and we're moving forward with resolving these issues.

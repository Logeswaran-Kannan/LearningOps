As we discussed during our call, the specified operator's busevent ID is not linked to any policy event history in the analytical layer. This indicates that there are no sales associated with this party ID. To proceed with further analysis on the source side, it's recommended to gather more information from the business user regarding the specific sales transactions in CDL. Any sample policy number, policy ID, or web reference related to the products they've sold would be highly beneficial. Currently, the data in the analytical layer aligns with our expectations based on the available information.

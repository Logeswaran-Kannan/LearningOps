Just a quick update on the sanity check: the testing team wrapped up the check in production, thanks to the support from the Run team. We found 4 open S2 defects in the process. Two of these defects need fixing in the quote tables; they're specific to SI records during the initial load, which occurred only in the production environment. Incremental changes seem fine, and Ben is currently investigating the situation.

The other 2 issues were raised by business users during UAT, related to reporting. The designer is looking into these. Right now, the business is alright with living with these issues.

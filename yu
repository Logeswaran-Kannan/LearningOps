Subject: Gathering Feedback on E2P Fix and UAT Testing

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this email finds you well.

I wanted to inform you that I have scheduled a meeting to gather your feedback on the E2P fix regarding the reports 'extract to panel' and 'panel changes' as part of our UAT testing. The report will be ready for UAT testing this afternoon, and I have set up the meeting for tomorrow to discuss any questions or concerns related to the change. Once the report is ready, we will proceed with moving it to production.

Looking forward to our discussion tomorrow and your valuable input on the E2P fix.

Best regards,

[Your Name]

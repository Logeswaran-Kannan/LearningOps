Thank you for giving me the chance to share my self-appraisal comments for Y23. I've provided detailed comments for each item in Go-perform, and I'm happy to discuss them further through a Teams meeting at your convenience.

I successfully completed my external exam on Azure Data Engineering.
I implemented a fully automated testing framework using Azure DevOps pipeline, which was well-received by the client.
I led the testing activities for the Aurora program, one of the biggest and long-running programs, coordinating with the offshore team for multiple releases. This program provides valuable business insights to the Sales team.
In addition to that, I led multiple other short-term programs concurrently.
Our program got nominated for the Client Year of Project award. Hopefully, we will win, as we earned trust from the client and stakeholders.
I upskilled and trained team members to adapt to the DEVOPS platform.
I created a centralized knowledge repository for the new testing platform that will be referred to by stakeholders and project teams.
I led the Bluebolt program and created multiple automation assets through Bluebolt, resulting in hard and soft dollar savings of $4,000 and an overall team savings of $6,000.
As a Senior Test BI lead at the client, I earned trust and created a good reputation among the client's technical front. This indirectly led to new business, replacing two competitor organizations with Cognizant on a Software as a Service platform â€“ a significant milestone for organizational expansion.

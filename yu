The policies reported as missing for Tom Richardson are actually present in the fact table and are accurately reflected in the reporting SQL. These policies align with the date mentioned by the user, except for policy 812. In this case, there are no action items required from DAVE 2 team. The next step involves the run team explaining this situation to the business user. Additionally, for the one policy where the date does not align, a check can be performed on the front end to verify the exact policy transaction date. Currently, DAVE reflects the value it receives from the source for this particular policy.

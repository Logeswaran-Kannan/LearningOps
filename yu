Thank you, Ben. In the best-case scenario, the cost associated with processing the same data using 2 DLT pipelines would ideally be offset by the reduction in processing time achieved with the addition of a third DLT pipeline. To ensure this balance, Sune, could you please confirm if these tables are evenly distributed across all three DLT pipelines? This confirmation would help us assume that there won't be significant deviations from a cost perspective.

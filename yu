Thank you for obtaining the policy details from the affected user. Based on our initial investigation, it appears that this issue is related to the CDL source data, specifically concerning the operator responsible for the sales. I can confirm that DAVE is functioning correctly.

In the next steps, I can provide the scenario that is causing this problem on the source side. I recommend consulting with Vinod to determine the appropriate contact on the source side.

Scenario: The policies shared by Pavan in this email chain, claimed by Paul Hardy with LOGINNAME - 04808 and associated with the Isell cost centre, are being incorrectly tagged under another individual, also named Paul Hardy with LOGINNAME - 84417, belonging to the Marketing cost centre in CDL. DAVE's reporting filters this record in the B2A report because LOGINNAME - 84417 is linked to the Marketing cost centre. It appears that CDL initially tagged the sales to LOGINNAME - 84417 instead of LOGINNAME - 04808, leading to this misclassification. Please advise Pavan from the CDL end to address this issue.

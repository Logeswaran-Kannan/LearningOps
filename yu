Hello Team,

Regarding the scenarios I discussed this morning concerning missing prov codes for New Business transactions, I conducted some investigations before raising a CDL incident. It appears that the RTPLOG_IDs that are missing in MV_RISKDETAIL are present in the RTPLOGXX table with valid prov codes populated for them. This seems to be an issue on our end. I have provided a sample below. These are the details for two of the samples that Sarah shared. The remaining samples are still in progress, and I will investigate them as soon as the Run team is available. I will continue to provide updates in this email chain.

Regarding another scenario related to GIPP pricing remedy, in our morning discussion, we talked about scenarios where the payment method changes from installment to PayInFull between NB CONF and MTA CONF transactions. We observed that this scenario occurs in production as well. It seems to be a valid scenario in production, and I would appreciate guidance on how to handle it.

Thank you.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

Hi Kate, the validation for the initial load in Preprod is done, and everything looks good except for the "AAX_DEACTIVATIONDATE" column. I couldn't find any values populated from the bronze, but the other newly added columns in the "cam_6_12" schema and the regression for other tables align with the existing benchmarked data. I believe the alter script provided here is intended for production use. The cost analysis is the only pending task.

Regarding the Azure portal, for the "cam_ingestion" tag, it currently shows an actual cost of Â£0.28. However, I have some doubts about whether it reflects all the costs at this point in time. We might need to wait until today to see the full cost reflected accurately in the Azure portal.

I made this group specifically for setting up the preprod environment for the upcoming insurance releases. In our current live environment, we can't separate the cost details for gold quote tables in Databricks. The tags used to find them include both silver and gold quotes, which makes the cost seem too high in production. I think this isn't right for the initial cost. Sungjin's work shouldn't depend on this. During our morning meeting, you mentioned that at the DLT level, we can see these cost details. Can you tell us how we can access that specific detail?

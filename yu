After processing the initial historical data of 700 files in the pre-production environment, we have captured the actual cost in pre-production and provided an estimated cost for a similar load in the production environment. Please note that these estimates are based on a high-level analysis of a sample set of records processed in the pre-production environment using the current Databricks cluster configuration.

The estimated production cost may vary based on factors such as data volume, cluster configuration, and cluster performance. It's important to understand that these estimates only cover compute costs, as storage costs cannot be segmented at the project level.

We recommend reviewing and discussing these estimates for potential performance enhancements. Additionally, it's advisable to cross-verify these estimates with the cloud council for pre-cost approval. Keep in mind that these are general estimates, and actual production costs may be influenced by various factors specific to the production environment.

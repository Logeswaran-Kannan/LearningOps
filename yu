We conducted two runs utilizing the old flow (2 DLT pipelines), and on average, processing two days' worth of test data in the lower environment incurred a cost of £2.85. With the introduction of 3 DLT pipelines, the cost reduced to £1.80. Typically, when you increase parallelism by adding another pipeline, you leverage more computational resources for parallel data processing. Although this can enhance performance and decrease overall processing time, it also comes with an associated increase in compute costs. However, our best-case scenario study indicates that the cost of processing the same data with 2 DLT pipelines can ideally be balanced by the reduction in processing time achieved with the addition of a third DLT pipeline.

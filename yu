Risks and Issues:

This release specifically focuses on the additional columns added to existing tables. Any issues related to previously existing elements in the production environment are considered out of scope for this release.
Any source data quality issues are also considered out of scope for this release.
For the column named AA_DEACTIVATEDATE, it was not populated from the source in the Preprod environment of Bronze and the analytical layer. The developer confirmed this with the source data team, stating that this scenario is less common in the Preprod environment and is not created in the source itself. Due to this, we have not been able to verify this column in Preprod. However, it has been verified in a lower test environment.
A high-level cost analysis has been conducted post the addition of these columns. The existing table shows no change in the increase of compute cost and time. However, this analysis is based on cluster configuration and lower environment, and it may change when releasing the code in production. Other parameters of production cluster configuration and dependencies are different. It is recommended to monitor the compute cost and run time for a couple of days to assess any changes.

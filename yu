Test Execution Progress:

Test execution for E2P is currently at 65% completion in the lower test environment.
Remaining test cases, including those related to report testing, incremental data validation, and UAT validation, have been scheduled to be conducted in preprod.
This decision is driven by limitations in data and source data quality in the lower test environment, mainly due to migration data disparities.
Test Plan and Cloud Cost Estimation:

The test plan has been shared with the project team.
Cloud cost estimation has been communicated to the cloud council for approval, a crucial step before moving the code to the preprod environment.
Test Data Availability Discrepancy:

Test data availability in preprod does not align with the data in production.
Deviation analysis is being performed to calibrate the data for UAT testing.
Discrepancies identified have been shared with the development team for further investigation and necessary action.

This problem falls under the category of a source data issue. The project team, in agreement with business users, has decided not to perform any data cleansing for this release. These scenarios will be accepted as they are. Additionally, a design change has been implemented to filter only the "Pass" status in the extract sent to the outbound feed. Any further refinement of requirements may be considered after the go-live if necessary.

From what Mahesh explained, the business wants the GIPP report to use "POS_APR" instead of "APR" in this hotfix. Initially, I thought the change should be made in both the fact and dataset to ensure the report reflects the correct APR value. Please correct me if I'm mistaken. I checked the test report version, and it still shows some policy count for APR greater than 50%. Could you please make the necessary changes in the dataset or refresh it to ensure the updated APR is reflected in the report?

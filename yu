Test Execution Plan for This Week:

E2P Fix - Preprod Completion:

Complete preprod initial, incremental validation, UAT, and TSR signoff for the E2P fix.
Today's Priority: Thoroughly understand the details of the data mismatch issue deviation.
The cost estimation for the E2P fix was based solely on the existing data in preprod and did not include the defect fix from the performance tuning release. Please share the TSR approval for the performance tuning project to highlight associated risks.
Analytical Layer Validation - Non-Migrated Data Release (TC 29th Jan):

Conclude analytical table validation, including functional and regression testing.
Compare data between Kingfisher and Analytical for Non-RTP tables.
For RTP tables, run functional processing comparisons between logs from either Kingfisher or Bronze.
Reveal defects related to analytical layer issues, perform data quality analysis, and address source data quality issues.
Business Scenario Validation in Silver and Gold Layer:

Map sample policies to business scenarios and validate.
Utilize the same sample for technical scenario validation once defects associated with the analytical layer are resolved.
Commercial MI Report Regression TD Readiness:

Obtain necessary access to understand NB (New Business), cancellation reports, and plan for test design.
Include access to risks associated with preprod data quality issues in the test design plan.

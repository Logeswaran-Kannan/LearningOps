Unexpected Leave Today

Hi [Manager's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. Unfortunately, I won't be able to make it to work today due to an emergency situation. My neighbour forgot to close a tap, and my property suffered water damage. A plumber is scheduled to visit today, and I need to be here to sort things out.

I'll do my best to resolve the issue and aim to join work in the late afternoon if everything gets sorted. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding.

Best regards,

[Your Name]

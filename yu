Weekly Test Summary:

Analytical Layer Blocker Issue:

A blocker issue related to larger message size in the Analytical layer has been resolved.
Data load in the lower test environment has been conducted to test the fix, and revalidation is currently in progress.
New Functionalities Release Plan:

New functionalities are planned for release in production based on milestones set at the layer level.
The first milestone is set for March 8th, targeting new changes for TS03 at the analytical level in the preprod environment.
The scope of this release includes moving two new tables and introducing new columns to two existing tables in preprod.
Renewal Data Handling:

It has been decided to dump production renewal data into the Bronze layer once the front end goes live.
The data will then be copied into the preprod Bronze layer and processed with the new codebase in preprod.
This approach ensures that no existing commercial dashboards generated from the analytical layer are impacted by renewal data.
It aims to gain confidence from business users before moving the code into production, followed by the release of other layers.

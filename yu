Usually, for all the key columns, if there are no values present, it should be treated as -1, right? For instance, in other fact tables like 'fact broker policy', we treat 'Agent_Key' as -1 if there's no match. However, in the insurer scheme key, it's just left as null if there's no match in the reference table. This seems to be the case for all key columns. It's working as designed, but I think we need some clarification on this general approach.

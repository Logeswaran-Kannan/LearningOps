During the sanity check, we've observed a discrepancy in the data for the newly added fields. We've noticed that data is populating for these columns only from today's incremental load. However, in the source, we see data for these fields even before today's date. Since we are currently performing only incremental loads, this data won't be present in the analytical layer. Could you clarify if this is aligned with the business expectation, or should we consider doing a full refresh to synchronize it with the source bronze?

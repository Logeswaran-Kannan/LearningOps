Hey team,

Hope you're doing well! ðŸŒŸ

I've got a little favor to ask. We're gearing up for UAT (User Acceptance Testing) for the upcoming E2P and Aurora TS03 releases, and I need some help prepping our preprod environment.

We want to make sure everything runs super smoothly for our business users during UAT. This includes validating new and regression reports, starting next week for E2P and then for TS03. Some releases are straightforward, no cost analysis needed, while others will need us to plan it out.

Can we get a hand from a dedicated developer to make sure everything is set up nicely? Most of our deliverables depend on this environment, and we really want to avoid the challenges we faced in previous releases - you know, stuff like performance hiccups, data syncing issues, data volume constraints, checkpoint problems, and some pesky cost and report connectivity challenges.

This time, I'd love to plan things a bit earlier, especially since UAT kicks off next week. I also want to emphasize the risks if our preprod environment isn't ready. Based on our past experiences, doing UAT in a not-so-ready environment has caused some issues.

Here are a few things we're looking at:

1. Our test environment has some source data issues, and any fixes from the source are incremental. This means we might not have enough data volume with the right realistic data for UAT. Business users are usually checking from a look-and-feel perspective rather than diving into the data.

2. Syncing up reference data manually from prod every time we create a new schema is turning out to be a bit tricky. It's not meeting our UAT expectations, and there are some security concerns about copying data from prod to the lower environment.

3. In the lower environment, it's a bit tough to figure out which functionality is in which schema. It's like a puzzle!

4. Regression testing, cost analysis, and performance optimization are a bit of a challenge in the lower environment. We want to make sure everything matches up with prod.

So, if we can get the preprod environment sorted out ASAP, it'll save us from a bunch of headaches down the road.

Thanks a ton for your help, and let me know if you have any questions!

Cheers,
[Your Name]

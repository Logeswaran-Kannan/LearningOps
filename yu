Hey Bhavya,

I've been looking at the samples, and there's an interesting observation. Some of them made it into the fact, while others didn't. The main issue seems to be that the samples not making it into the fact have the 'valid_to' column populated, which shouldn't be the case according to the requirements. Abinaya might need to check why these samples with 'valid_to' populated are being created.

On the flip side, the 'party_guid' that made it into the fact doesn't seem right. It's linked to the wrong contract number. This is something that needs fixing.

Let me know if you have any thoughts on this.

Cheers!

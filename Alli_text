Subject: Thanks for Yesterday's Connect – Request for Feedback & Sign-off

Hi [Recipient's Name],

Thanks for connecting yesterday—it was great to walk through the demo together.

As discussed, I've attached the Confluence link and the workbook details used during the demo session. Could you please take a moment to review these materials?

I'd appreciate your feedback and sign-off if everything looks good.

Thanks again, and please let me know if you need anything further.

Best regards,

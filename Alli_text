Depending on the feasibility, they’ll try to include those in the extended scenario pack. From our side, we’re expecting that update by Wednesday.

For any cases that can’t be included, Graham will help prioritize whether they should be descoped or still kept. If they’re still required, then Suraj will handle those manually.

In terms of timeline — Suraj is reaching out to Nick’s team today to get confirmation on feasibility. Then by Wednesday, Nick’s team should confirm which extra scenarios they can cover. From Thursday onward, the expectation is that Nick’s team will be ready with the automation package for test data creation.

In parallel, Suraj will align his manual coverage plan based on how many scenarios Nick’s team can or can’t include.

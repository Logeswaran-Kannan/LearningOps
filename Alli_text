Hi [Recipient's Name],

I’ve received another reminder regarding the pending approval for my IAM access. If it hasn’t been addressed yet, I’d really appreciate it if you could provide your approval or response to the concerned team by end of today to avoid any disruption in access from tomorrow.

Please let me know if there’s anything needed from my side to support this.

Thanks so much for your help!
Best regards,
[Your Name]

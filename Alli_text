I was exploring the Test Plan feature in DevOps for automated test case creation, but it looks like I don’t have the access to create test plans or test cases. I checked my permissions, and it seems the Test Plan option isn’t enabled for my user.

Would you be able to help enable that on your end? I couldn’t find a specific test-related group I could be added to. The only one I saw was something like Project Collection Test Service Account, which has test controller actions allowed—but I’m not sure that’s the right one for this.

Let me know if this is something you can help with!

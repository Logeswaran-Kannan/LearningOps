Hi [Recipient's Name],

I’ve received another follow-up email regarding my IAM access approval. In case this hasn’t been addressed yet, kindly provide your approval or respond to the concerned team by end of day today to help avoid any access disruption starting tomorrow.

Please let me know if there’s anything I need to action from my side.
Thanks in advance for your support!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
